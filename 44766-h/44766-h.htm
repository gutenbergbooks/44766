<h2><a name="I" id="I"></a>I<br /><br />
<small>WHAT YOU SHOULD HAVE IN YOUR WORK BOX,
SEWING ON BUTTONS, BASTING, DARNING</small></h2>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">You</span> will find that you are happiest when
doing things for those you love; and what
greater help can you give than by learning
to do things for yourself that now those who love
you best do for you? The little everyday things
that appear to be so simple, yet take so much of the
mother's time should be the things first to learn.
There are so many things that one could do if
one only knew how, that it seems a shame to waste
time. Dolly needs new clothes, mother always
needs help with her sewing; and then, too, the numerous
birthdays and Christmases follow so quickly
one on top of another, that there is hardly a chance
to save up for one before the next is here. Many
a hard problem for the little mother will be solved
in this book.</p>

<p>It is lovely to have a little work-box fixed up with
thread, needles, and scissors, all of your own, and if
you ask mother, I am sure she will give some of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
her threads to help you start one. If you take a
card and shape it like a Maltese cross you will have
space for four colours of threads. You will need a
card for the white alone because you will find you use
so much more of it. You must have a little thimble
and always use it or your finger will look cramped
when working. Have you noticed how pretty
ladies look when sewing? Well, you must do as
they do, tap your needle
with the thimble to send
it through the material
(<a href="#Fig1">Figure 1</a>).</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 300px;">
<a name="Fig1"></a><img src="images/i_018.jpg" width="300" height="203" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 1. The way to use your
thimble</div>
</div>

<p>Have you ever wondered
and wondered why it is that
buttons have the horrid
habit of dropping off just when you wanted to dress
quickly or take Sally Ann walking? Well, I will
whisper the reasons for this: the first is, that the
thread might have been worn out from active service;
or the thread used might have been weak; or lastly,
which is probably the true cause, the button might
have been sewn too close to the material and came off
the first time it was used. Mother may not be around
to help you when the accident happens, and would
you not feel proud to sew it on for yourself?</p>

<p>To sew a button on securely you should make a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
pin-hole where the button is to be placed. A four-hole
white button is the easiest to work on. Thread
a No. 7 needle with a length of No. 40 white sewing
cotton, bring the ends together and make a knot.
The right length thread is measured from the tip
of the thimble finger to the elbow. When a thread
is used double it should be twice the length of this.
A neat knot is made by holding the threaded needle
in the right hand and by taking the end or ends,
as the case may be, between the thumb and first
finger of the left hand. Keep the thread tightly
stretched, wind it around the top of the first finger,
then move the finger down the thumb, carrying the
thread with it about half an inch. Now with the
nail of the second finger bring the knot thus formed
to the end of the thread.</p>

<p>A large ungainly knot is a disfigurement to a
piece of sewing. You are now ready to adjust the
button; place the knot on the upper or right side so
that it will be concealed; after adjusting the button
put a pin across the top and sew securely through
the holes, crossing the threads. Sew not less than
three times through each hole. Remove the pin.
Insert the needle from underneath, then bring it
out between the button and cloth close to the
centre of the button. Wind the thread tightly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
around the neck of the button three or four times.
(The neck is the threads between the button and material.)
Wrapping the threads around protects
the stitches and allows
room for the buttonhole
to lie under the button.
Take the thread through
to the wrong side and take
up three stitches, make a
short stitch on the material and cut the thread
close (<a href="#Fig2-3">Figures 2 and 3</a>).</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 300px;">
<a name="Fig2-3"></a><img src="images/i_020.jpg" width="300" height="182" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Figs. 2 and 3</div>
</div>

<p>When a three-hole button is used the stitches form
a triangle on the top of the button. A shoe-button
should be sewed with a No. 2 needle and coarse black
thread. The stitches are taken through the shank of
the button. Fasten off the thread after sewing on
two buttons, for if they are all on one continuous
string or thread and that breaks, all the buttons are
apt to come off. If each button is securely fastened
the thread may be passed, however, from one to the
other.</p>

</div>

<p>Now I know you want to do some real sewing;
it must not be big or you will get very tired and think
sewing is not as pleasant as you fancied. The
simplest stitch in sewing is basting. This is used to
hold materials together until you are ready to make<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
firmer stitches. In the following illustration the
even and uneven basting stitches are shown (Figures
<a href="#Fig4">4</a> and <a href="#Fig5">5</a>). They must be straight. Even basting
stitches should be taken about a quarter of an inch
apart and in the running stitch which is fine basting
about an eighth or a sixteenth of an inch. Pretty
huck pillows can be made of even and uneven
basting or running stitches. A leaf, star or a
figure cut out and traced on a piece of muslin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
will make a nice design for running stitches
(<a href="#Fig6">Figure 6</a>).</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<a name="Fig6"></a><img src="images/i_022.jpg" width="600" height="576" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 6. A simple design in running stitch</div>
</div>

<p>If you will examine different kinds of materials
before they are cut, you will note that the threads
run in two directions. The threads running lengthwise
must be the stronger, as they have more strain
on them. They are called the warp. The warp
is set up first before the weaving begins. The
threads running crosswise are called the woof. It
is the weaker thread and forms the edge or selvage.</p>

<p>If you will take a card three inches square and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
prick a line of dots half an inch from the top and
bottom edges and prick a line a quarter of an inch
apart you will have a little loom. The dots must
be directly under each other. A piece of coloured
worsted and a large-eyed crewel needle
No. 2 will be required. Make a knot at the
end of your thread and start from the upper right
hand hole on the wrong side. Bring your thread
up through the hole and down through the lower
right-hand dot. The needle must now come up
through the next hole at the bottom and the thread
be again stretched across the card.</p>

<p>When every hole has been filled and you have
several rows of straight lines, fasten off the worsted
in the back. Another shade of wool should be selected
so that you can distinguish the warp from the
woof. The thread you are now going to use is the
woof; commence at the top and go straight across
to the left line, up over and down under each thread
and so on till the row is completed. In weaving the
next row, pick up the threads of the warp that you
went over last time. Alternate rows agree (<a href="#Fig7">Figure
7</a>). When finished, the little piece can be used as
a doll's mat.</p>

<p>To darn your stockings is almost as simple a
matter as this weaving. Instead, however, of starting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
the thread of the warp on an even line, as on the
card, start some higher than the others.   The
reason for this is that an even line will be apt to
make an uncomfortable seam in your stocking.   The
woof threads are always connected
to the stocking. A
darning ball should be used
under the hole. In darning
cashmere or woollen stockings
it is best to allow the warp to
be very slack as wool shrinks
considerably in washing. Wool
should be used for darning woollen stockings.</p>

<p>Have you ever belonged to a sewing club? If<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
not, try to start one and see how much fun there is
in it. The club should meet either on Friday or
Saturday afternoon, after the school work is finished.
Every girl should bring her stockings to darn and
another piece of work, so that when the darning is
over she will have something to work on. If there
are more than four in the club it is a very hard
thing to keep up. Three is the ideal number for it.
It is better to have a small number&mdash;three, for instance.
A large club is apt to be distracting, but
three or four little girls, with the right helpful
spirit, will find such meetings very instructive and
entertaining.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<a name="Fig9"></a><img src="images/i_028.jpg" width="500" height="145" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 9. The right way to hold your scissors</div>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Stitching</span> is witching," the song book says,
and it is true, for after we know that stitch
there are a hundred and one things we can
do. Some people call it back-stitching and we
must try to remember that, so that we shall understand
of what they are talking. Get mother to
give you a piece of material to practise on that has
a stripe in it. Now take your scissors (<a href="#Fig9">Figure 9</a>)
and cut out two three-inch squares. Baste the two
squares together a quarter of an inch from the edge.
Hold the square over the first finger of the left
hand ready for the back-stitching. Let the basting
run up and down over your finger. Start from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
top and make a small stitch backward, on the right
side of the material, instead of forward as you did
in running (<a href="#Fig10">Figure 10</a>). Pass the needle under
until you have a stitch twice as long on the wrong
side as that on the right.   Take the next stitch
backward close to the end of the last one on the
right.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<a name="Fig10"></a><img src="images/i_029.jpg" width="600" height="204" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 10. Back-stitching</div>
</div>

<p>Remember that the stitch you take backward
is only half as long as the one you take forward.
Stitching always looks very different on the wrong
side, but on the right side it ought to look like machine
stitching. This stitch might be called the lion
stitch, because it is so strong. It is used to join two
edges together, as for the seams in bean-bags or
cushion covers.</p>

<p>In places where there will not be much strain we
use a quicker stitch, which is called the half-back
stitch (<a href="#Fig11">Figure 11</a>). This is very much like the stitching
of which I have been telling you. The wrong
side will look about the same, but on the right side<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
instead of the stitches touching there will be a
space, then a stitch of equal length.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<a name="Fig11"></a><img src="images/i_030.jpg" width="600" height="199" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 11. The half-back stitch</div>
</div>

<p>The next stitch to learn is the combination-stitch,
which is made up of both the running and the
back-stitch (<a href="#Fig12">Figure 12</a>). It is a stitch that is greatly
used for sewing long seams, as on underwear. By
this stitch we can cover the distance in about half
the time that back-stitching would take.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<a name="Fig12"><img src="images/i_030a.jpg" width="600" height="221" alt="" />
</a><div class="caption">Fig. 12. The combination running and back-stitch</div>
</div>

<p>Whenever you can avoid making a knot, do so,
because it spoils the look of your work on the wrong
side. You can start your work, if it is a seam, for
example, by making two or three stitches on top of
each other. Follow the thread of the warp or woof<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
of the material as much as possible. After fastening
your thread, make two fine running stitches forward
and one back. Keep the stitches the same length.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<a name="Fig13"></a><img src="images/i_031.jpg" width="600" height="268" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 13. Over-casting</div>
</div>

<p>Over-casting is used on unfinished or cut edges
to keep them from fraying (<a href="#Fig13">Figure 13</a>). The stitches
all slant from right to left. Take the stitches one
eighth of an inch deep and one quarter of an inch
apart.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<a name="Fig14"></a><img src="images/i_031b.jpg" width="600" height="238" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 14. Over-handing</div>
</div>

<p>Over-handing is fine over-casting and used to
connect two finished edges together (<a href="#Fig14">Figure 14</a>),
as when sewing lace on ruffles, or joining selvages.
What is the selvage? It is the edge of the warp.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
The next time mother goes shopping ask her to take
you with her. When she tells the salesman she wants
so many yards of goods, whether it is for kitchen
towels or a dress for herself or for you, notice how
the goods is measured. The salesman will measure
along one of the finished sides of the goods. These
finished edges are called selvages.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<a name="Fig15"></a><img src="images/i_032.jpg" width="600" height="248" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 15. The seam opened</div>
</div>

<p>Make the stitches in over-handing as small as
possible, keeping the stitches even. Sew through
both pieces of the material. Hold your work between
your thumb and first finger. Here again it
is not necessary to make a knot. Let a half-inch
of the end of your thread lie on top of the material
toward the left side; the over-handing stitches will
cover this end. When the over-handing is finished
run your thumb-nail along the stitches on the right
side. If your stitches are too deep there will be a
seam on the wrong side, whereas if the instructions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
have been followed carefully the material will lie
perfectly flat (<a href="#Fig15">Figure 15</a>).</p>

<p>Now we are ready to help mother hem the new
kitchen towels. First see that the edge you are to
hem is straight. If it is not, pull out a thread so as
to mark a line to cut by. You must take a thread
that runs the entire way across the end of the towel.
Cut carefully along the space out of which the
thread came. Get a piece of
card that has two smooth or
straight edges and make a
notch one-half inch from the
corner (<a href="#Fig16">Figure 16</a>). A half-inch hem is the one commonly
used on a towel.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 300px;">
<a name="Fig16"></a><img src="images/i_033.jpg" width="300" height="113" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 16. A notched card</div>
</div>

<p>If mother likes to have her towels with a wider or
narrower hem, notch the card the size she wishes.
Turn the material back one-quarter inch and crease
it down with your thumb-nail. A second fold is
made the width of the hem. Take your measuring
card and, placing the end of it on the double edge,
see if your hem is exactly the width desired. Baste
along the first folded edge to hold the material
together for hemming (Figures <a href="#Fig17">17</a> and <a href="#Fig18">18</a>). Hold
the edge to be hemmed toward you. Do not knot
your thread. Insert the needle at the extreme right
of the hem.   Pull the needle through, leaving a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
little end, as in over-handing, to be fastened down
with the hemming itself.</p>

<div class="caption">Fig. 18. The second step</div>
</div>

<p>Your needle should slant as shown in the diagram
(<a href="#Fig19">Figure 19</a>). Take a stitch right through all the
thicknesses of the material. Be sure that it goes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
through to the other side. The fewer the threads
taken on the needle at the same time, the neater the
result will be. The stitches should slant from right
to left. The stitches must be close together if we
want fine hemming. Let each stitch be the same
size as the other and slant in the same direction.
The right side of the hem looks like a row of short
dashes.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<a name="Fig19"></a><img src="images/i_035.jpg" width="500" height="249" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 19. The way the needle should slant</div>
</div>

<p>If your needle gets "sticky" when you are sewing,
you should pass it through your emery-bag till it
is shiny and sharp again. The needle is apt to get
that way if your hands perspire. Ladies who like
to keep their sewing looking fresh and white, as if
hands had never touched it, find it a good plan to
wash their hands in a little vinegar, or lemon and
water.</p>

<p>It is very necessary to sit so that the light falls
over your left shoulder. A little straight-back
chair is another good help in sewing. Do you know<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
that many of our English great-grandmothers had
very straight backs? When they were little girls
they had to sit on a very straight, tall chair, an hour
or two every day. A foot-stool was placed under
their feet, and their shoulders strapped against the
chair. Of course they did not sit there idle, but a
piece of fine sewing was given them to work. You
see they did not have the opportunity to run around
and play as you have. Their chief recreation was
their dancing lesson.</p>

<div class="caption">Fig. 20. A corner basted ready
for hemming</div>
</div>

<p>The towel finished, the next thing to learn is how
to turn a corner and hem it. Shall we make a
cover for Sally Ann's bed
or a dust-cloth for mother?
In either case cut a piece
of material eighteen inches
square and turn a hem and
baste it as you did for the
towel. The next side is
folded the same as the first.
The corner should form a
perfect square (<a href="#Fig20">Figure 20</a>).
Sometimes the material is very thick and the hem
wide; in that case it is wise to cut a little oblong
piece out of the corner as shown in the illustration
(<a href="#Fig21">Figure 21</a>).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<a name="Fig21"></a><div class="caption">Fig. 21. The material cut
from a corner</div>
</div>

<p>Napkins and table-covers should be sewed with
a French hem. Make a turn about a sixteenth of
an inch deep. The second
turn should be about three
sixteenths of an inch wide.
Fold the hem back so that it
touches the right side of the
material. The hem is connected
to the material with
tiny over-hand stitches. Open
the hem, when finished crease
with the thumb-nail till it lies perfectly flat.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<a name="Fig22"></a><img src="images/i_037a.jpg" width="500" height="317" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 22. Whipping</div>
</div>

<p>A pretty new way of finishing a handkerchief is
to roll the material for the edge instead of folding it.
Over-cast or, as we sometimes say, whip it with
delicate-coloured cotton, (<a href="#Fig22">Figure 22</a>). The nicest
material for handkerchiefs is fine linen, but lawn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
is cheaper for practice work. Hold the wrong side
of the material to you. Then roll about one eighth
of an inch between the thumb and first finger of your
left hand. Do not roll more than an inch of the
hem at a time. Take a needle and thread it with a
piece of coloured cotton. In this case it is permissible
to make a knot. Insert the needle at the beginning
of the roll. Over-cast or whip the rolled edge.
The stitches should encircle the roll and not go
through it. When the rolled inch is over-casted,
roll another inch and repeat in this manner till the
whole handkerchief is worked. If you desire, when
you have finished one side, you can whip in an
opposite direction toward the point at which you
started, thus forming a cross with each return stitch
(<a href="#Fig23">Figure 23</a>).</p>

<div class="caption">Fig. 23. A pretty finish for handkerchiefs</div>

<p>Lace is sewed to raw edges by rolling and whipping
the material and connecting the lace at the same
time.</p>

<div class="caption">Fig. 26. The
tape open flat

</div>

<p>Tapes should be on all towels and on all your skirts
and dresses that are to hang on nails or pegs. Take
a piece of fine tape about five inches long. Crease
one end down one quarter of an inch (<a href="#Fig25">Figure 25</a>).
If the tape-loop is to be sewed on a towel
find the direct centre of the top edge
of the towel. Lay the tape with the
creased end open flat on the towel (<a href="#Fig26">Figure
26</a>). Sew along the creased
line with back-stitching.
Fold the other end of the
tape over, baste it down
so that it entirely covers
the stitches already made
and with small hemming
stitches connect the tape to the material
(<a href="#Fig27">Figure 27</a>). There should be two
tape-loops on your dress or separate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
skirt. There is usually too much weight for only
one loop. Place a loop in each armhole of the waist
or dress. For the skirt, measure the waist-band
and place the loops so that the band
is divided in thirds.</p>

</div>

<p>Do you know that very few people
sew on hooks and eyes properly? Yet
there is no difficulty in sewing them
correctly and they look much nicer.
Take the eye, connect it to the material
with two stitches that make a cross.
With the same thread pass the needle
to the left-hand loop. Insert the needle
in the material so that
the eye of the needle is within
the loop and the point of the
needle comes just outside. See
that the thread passes from left
to right <i>under</i> the point of the
needle. Draw the needle
through and repeat in this manner
until the two loops of the
eye are firmly connected to the material. Sometimes
it is necessary to cover the upper part of
the eye. In that case cover the metal with fine
over-and-over stitches as shown in (<a href="#Fig28B">Figure 28B</a>).</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>

<p>The loop of the hook is sewed on in a very similar
manner at the base, while the
top of the hook is caught with
eight or nine over-and-over-stitches
(<a href="#Fig29">Figure 29</a>). These
stitches are taken under the
hook portion and connect the
under side only. Measure accurately
just where every eye
goes and place the hook so that when it meets the
eye it will be straight.   A sixteenth of an inch out
of the way spoils the appearance
and is apt to pull the material
crooked. Another point to remember
is that it is not a good
plan to place the eyes on the
extreme edge. A margin of some
size is most necessary to extend
beyond the eyes. Sometimes it is necessary to sew
a piece of material so that it extends one inch beyond
the eyes if the eyes are sewed on the extreme
edge of the finished garment. This piece is called
the fly piece.</p>

<h2><a name="III" id="III"></a>III<br /><br />
<small>GATHERING, SEWING ON BANDS, A PRACTICAL
SEWING APRON, HEMMED PATCHES,
GUSSETS AND TUCKS</small></h2>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Though</span> I know you don't like making
samples, I am going to ask you to make
a little apron for a doll, as a model, before
we make a real big one.</p>

<p>Get a piece of muslin five by nine inches and a
No. 9 sewing needle. Thread it with a piece of
No. 70 cotton. Baste an eighth of an inch hem on
both of the five-inch sides, and a three-quarter of
an inch hem on one of the nine-inch sides.</p>

<p>The basting of the three sides being finished we
will now start to gather the fourth side. Thread
a No. 8 needle with No. 50 thread. Use a thread
a trifle longer than nine inches. Make a good-sized
knot in the thread so that the end cannot slip
through the material. Start from the right-hand
side of the piece and insert the needle on the under
side. Let the knot come on top of the narrow hem
about one quarter of an inch from the raw edge.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>

<p>The needle is now in position on the right side of
the material. Take up several stitches on the needle
before pulling it through (<a href="#Fig30">Figure 30</a>). The stitches
are nothing more than running stitches. When the
running has been worked across the nine inches of
the material, take the needle out and make a knot
in the thread.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<a name="Fig30"></a><img src="images/i_043.jpg" width="500" height="277" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 30. Gathering the apron</div>
</div>

<p>Put a pin, vertically, close to the last stitch.
Take up only a few threads of the material on the
pin. Draw up the running thread so that you have
about three and a half inches of gathering. Wind
the thread that extends beyond the gathering over
the top and under the point of the pin a number of
times, crossing the thread at the middle of the pin
so that it forms an eight (<a href="#Fig31">Figure 31</a>).</p>

<p>To allow the gathering to fall evenly, it will be
necessary to stroke it. Use a No. 2 needle for this
purpose. With the right side of the work toward<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
you begin at the left-hand edge. Hold the work
between the left thumb and forefinger, keeping the
thumb below the gathering thread. Put the point
of the No. 2 needle under the gathering thread,
holding it obliquely. Press the needle toward the
thumb, bringing the little plait under the thumb
and drawing the needle downward. Pinch the little
plait down lightly with your thumb. Continue in
this way, putting the needle under each stitch
(<a href="#Fig32">Figure 32</a>).</p>

<div class="caption">Fig. 31. Gathers ready for stroking</div>
</div>

<p>Let us now put a band and strings on our apron.
Cut two strips of material ten inches long by two
inches wide. These are for the strings. Baste an
eighth of an inch hem on the two long sides of each
strip. Make a three-quarter of an inch hem on
each string.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>

<p>Over-hand the ends of the broad hem. All the
hems that are basted on the strings and the material
itself should be hemmed with fine stitches.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<a name="Fig32"></a><img src="images/i_045.jpg" width="600" height="306" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 32. Gathering Strokes</div>
</div>

<p>Cut another strip two and a half inches wide
by five inches long. This is the band. Turn down
one eighth of an inch of the material all around the
band. Crease the band in half, lengthwise, so that
the edges, just folded, are inside.</p>

<p>Find the centre of the gathered material and the
centre of the opened band. Holding the wrong
side of the apron toward you, pin the middle of
the apron to the middle of the band. Pin the
gathered side of the apron to the band, three quarters
of an inch from each end of it.</p>

<p>Wind the gathering thread around the left-hand
pin, drawing the thread up to fit the band. With
the point of the needle adjust the gathers so that the
fullness is evenly distributed along the band. Holding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
the gathers toward you, baste with small stitches
a little above the gathering thread.</p>

<p>Turn up the band and on the right side of the
apron hem the band in it, catching up a gather with
each stitch. Some people prefer to stitch along the
basting line instead of hemming (<a href="#Fig33">Figure 33</a>).</p>

<div class="caption">Fig. 33. Taking up a gather with every stitch</div>
</div>

<p>Baste the other side of the band down, and hem
as on the right side. Insert the strings in the band.
Hem in the same way as on the band, first the right
side and then the left side, and now your little apron
is completed (<a href="#Fig34">Figure 34</a>).</p>

<p>Would you not like to have a sewing apron that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
you can use as a bag when you are not wearing it?
It is such an easy thing to make that after you have
one for yourself you will be making them for your
friends for Christmas.</p>

<div class="caption">Fig. 34. The apron completed</div>
</div>

<p>Get mother to measure you from the waist to
the knees. The material for the apron should be
one and a half this measurement. Turn one third
of the material back. Baste the double edges
together and sew with fine combination stitches.</p>

<p>Turn this piece inside out. Crease back one eighth
of an inch edge of this pocket, as it were. Baste
a piece of beading over this raw edge right around
the back of the apron. Be careful not to sew up
the pocket.</p>

<p>The beading on the back must be the same distance
from the bottom as the beading in front;
that is, we must keep a straight line. Sew on the
extreme edges of the beading with fine running
stitches, to connect it to the material. Now as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
the ribbon we are to run in the beading must serve
as a draw string, as well as for decoration, it will
be necessary to put two pieces in. So get a narrow
ribbon about one half the width of the openings in
the beading. Each piece of ribbon must be long
enough to go once around the apron and enough
of the ends left to tie double bows&mdash;one for each
side. Start one piece of the ribbon at the right-hand
side of the apron and the other at the left.</p>

<p>The top of the apron or single piece is finished with
a piece of beading which is sewed on, as on the
pocket. A ribbon long enough to go around your
waist and to tie a bow in the back is run through the
beading (<a href="#Fig35">Figure 35</a>).</p>

<p>When the apron is not being worn your work can
be placed in the large pocket and the single section<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
folded within the pocket. The ribbons are then
drawn up tight and "bravo!" you have a work bag
fit for a queen (<a href="#Fig36">Figure 36</a>).</p>

<p>There are so many kinds of rents or holes that
may happen to your clothes that it is worth the
while to know how to mend the various kinds.
There is an old adage that says, "Waste makes
want," and we would spend a small fortune in clothes
if every time a wee hole made its appearance we
discarded the garment.</p>

<p>If it is a circular hole in a dress or underbody,
as often happens, under the arms, we will use the
square patch. Cut a piece of the same kind of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
material, three inches square, or larger if necessary.
Turn a fold of one eighth of an inch on the four
edges of this square. Crease it lengthwise and
crosswise.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 400px;">
<a name="Fig37"></a><img src="images/i_050.jpg" width="400" height="437" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 37. The patch hemmed to
the material</div>
</div>

<p>Crease the material on which the patch is to be
laid lengthwise and
crosswise through the
tear. Pin the small piece
or patch on the wrong
side of the large piece,
or garment, so that the
creases run in the same
direction. The warp
must run the same way
in both pieces. One
sixteenth of an inch
from the edges run a basting thread. Hem the four
sides on the patch to the material (<a href="#Fig37">Figure 37</a>).</p>

<div class="caption">Fig. 38. The pin in each corner
of the patch</div>
</div>

<p>On the garment side make
a crease half an inch wide,
from the hemming, on the
four sides. Four little squares
will be formed in the corners.
Crease along the diagonal of
each square. Place a pin
one eighth of an inch from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
each corner, within the patch (<a href="#Fig38">Figure 38</a>). Cut
the garment from the centre of the tear to the
pins. Repeat this
on each side, cutting
along the crease
which you made,
one half inch from
the hemming.</p>

<p>Turn in one
eighth of an inch
and baste. Hem
all around (Figure<a href="#Fig39">
39</a>).</p>

<div class="caption">Fig. 39. The garment side of the patch</div>
</div>

<p>In patching material such as checked or striped
ginghams, percales, or other materials, the stripes or
the checks must
match so that the
patch is not too apparent
(<a href="#Fig40">Figure 40</a>).</p>

<div class="caption">Fig. 40. Matching the stripes</div>
</div>

<p>Have you ever
noticed how the slit
or placket of a petticoat
or side opening
of drawers is
finished? A piece of
material is put in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
of an odd shape to strengthen the openings. This
is called a gusset. Suppose that you were making
a petticoat. Join the skirt up the back from the
bottom, but leave eight inches open at the top.
This top opening is the placket. But let us take
a small piece of material and practise making the
back of a skirt. We will put a hem and a few tucks
at the bottom of the material first.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<a name="Fig41"></a><img src="images/i_052.jpg" width="600" height="298" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 41. Basting the tuck</div>
</div>

<p>Make a measuring card of a straight strip with
an eighth, three eighths, and three quarters of an
inch notches.</p>

<p>Crease and fold a wide hem (three quarters of
an inch), using the measuring card as a guide.</p>

<p>Over-hand each end of the hem. Now baste
along the hem. The over-handing must be done
before the basting. Now hem this wide hem.</p>

<p>Again, using the cardboard measure, on the right
side of the model fold a crease three quarters of an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
inch above the hem. Begin at the right-hand side
to crease and baste (<a href="#Fig41">Figure 41</a>).</p>

<p>With a fine, even, running stitch, an eighth of an
inch below the crease, make the tuck (<a href="#Fig42">Figure 42</a>).
Measure every few stitches to keep the seam straight.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<a name="Fig42"></a><img src="images/i_053.jpg" width="600" height="217" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 42. Making the tuck</div>
</div>

<p>If a second tuck is desired, measure from the
tuck instead of the hem.</p>

<p>Now we are ready for the slit which is in the centre
top. On the wrong side start at the top with an
eighth of an inch
hem, but decrease it
to almost nothing
right to the bottom
(<a href="#Fig43">Figure 43</a>). Fold the
other side in the
same manner. In
hemming the two
sides, start at the top.</p>

<div class="caption">Fig. 43. The placket hemmed</div>
</div>

<p>Now let us practise
making gussets<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
on a piece of paper. Cut a piece of paper three
inches square. Fold it from corner to corner and
cut (<a href="#Fig44">Figure 44</a>).
Turn the straight or
short edges of the
paper one eighth of
an inch and fold
along the two shorter
edges (<a href="#Fig45">Figure 45</a>).</p>

<a name="Fig44"></a><img src="images/i_054.jpg" width="400" height="233" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 44. The triangle</div>

<p>Hold the paper with the straight edge down,
measure it from the two points one quarter of an

paper and fold like model.</p>

<p>Cut off the two points one quarter inch from each
corner on the thread of the
goods (<a href="#Fig46">Figure 46</a>). Turn
these two straight ends and
the bias edge of paper one
eighth of an inch (Figure<a href="#Fig47">

down one eighth of an inch

(<a href="#Fig48">Figure 48</a>).</p>

<h2><a name="IV" id="IV"></a>IV<br /><br />
<small>A DOLL'S SKIRT AND SEWING CASE, BINDINGS,
DOLL'S BED LINEN AND A PIN CASE</small></h2>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Let</span> us suppose that Sally Ann measures twelve
inches from the crown of her head
to the soles of her feet and that you would
like to make her a gored skirt like mother's. Would
you not feel happier if you made the pattern and
then cut the skirt yourself?</p>

<p>Take a piece of paper twelve by nine inches
wide, mark every inch on both the long sides of
the paper. Lay a ruler so that it touches the
centre of the space between the first and second
dots on the upper edge, and between the second
and third dots on the lower edge. This will
form the half of the front gore of the skirt.
Mark it, "half of front."</p>

<p>Now draw a line from the second dot on the
upper edge to the centre of the space between the
fourth and fifth dots of the lower edge. Connect
the sixth dot on the upper and lower edges, mark this
section "side gore." Connect the eleventh dot on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
lower and upper edges and mark this section "back."
The remaining inch mark "belt." (<a href="#Fig52">Figure 52</a>).</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<a name="Fig52"></a><img src="images/i_058.jpg" width="600" height="407" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 52. The pattern drawn</div>
</div>

<p>Cut the pattern apart along the lines drawn.</p>

<p>Take a piece of muslin twenty-four by nine inches.
Tear off two inches of the muslin on the length for
the band and then ten inches for the back of the
skirt.</p>

<p>Fold the remaining piece of muslin with the two
short edges together so that the doubled piece
measures six inches by nine. Place the straight edge
of front of skirt pattern on the fold of the material and
the edge of the side gore on the other edge. Pin
the pattern down securely and cut through both
thicknesses of the material (<a href="#Fig53">Figure 53</a>).</p>

<p>Pin the skirt together, placing a straight edge of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
a gore to a bias. Baste a quarter-inch seam along
the finished edges of each gore, holding the bias
edge toward you. Sew the seams up with combination
stitches. Press open the seams and over-cast
each one to keep it from fraying.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<a name="Fig53"></a><img src="images/i_059.jpg" width="600" height="418" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 53. The back, side gore and front</div>
</div>

<p>Fold a hem at the bottom of the skirt an inch
and a quarter wide. Baste the hem so that seam
comes to seam. On the front gore there will be a
fullness. Gather this fullness in with fine running
stitches and baste. Use a separate thread for the
gathering. Now hem around the whole skirt.</p>

<p>Cut the placket two inches down through the
centre back. Turn a hem on the right side one
half inch wide and on the left one eighth inch.
Sew the hem.</p>

<p>Lap the wide hem over the narrow at the bottom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
of the placket and stitch across the wide hem two
rows of stitching one eighth of an inch apart.</p>

<p>Turn in the strip you cut off at first for the band
one quarter of an inch on the two short sides and
on one of the long sides.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<a name="Fig54"></a><img src="images/i_060.jpg" width="600" height="693" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 54. The skirt</div>
</div>

<p>Fold lengthwise, find centre of band and crease;
one inch from this, crease again.</p>

<p>Place and pin band in the same way as for the
gusset described in the last chapter, placing the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
middle crease at the middle of front of skirt. Then
pin the band also at the creases on either side of
centre. Gather each side of the skirt that is left.
Draw in the thread to fit belt. Spread the gathers
so that most of the fullness is in the back.</p>

<p>Over-hand the ends and hem second side of the
placket. This finishes the skirt (<a href="#Fig54">Figure 54</a>).</p>

<p>A basket or box of some sort is very nice to have,
as we have said above, for your sewing, but suppose
you were going to sew with another friend and you
wanted a handy case in which to carry your sewing
implements? A cloth case that can be folded or
rolled is very much more convenient and may be
carried in the large pocket of your apron. One
made of denim is inexpensive, wears well, and is
highly practicable. One yard will make you a case.</p>

<p>Cut a piece of green denim sixteen by fifteen inches
long. Turn up four inches of the material, baste
down both sides. Baste a four-inch pocket on the
left-hand corner of your case. The rest of the
case divide in two. This will hold your darning
cotton that comes on cards.</p>

<p>We have a pretty way of finishing this case, which
is not only ornamental but strong, and that is to
bind it. Get a piece of tape long enough to go
around the whole case. Crease it lengthwise so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
that one edge comes slightly below the other. Open
it and lay it on denim and then neatly back-stitch
the right side and hem the wrong. The hemming
should be just below the back-stitching, and must
not be seen on the right side. Allow enough tape at
the corners to make a good angle. Both sides of the
corner must be treated alike.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<a name="Fig55"></a><img src="images/i_062.jpg" width="600" height="346" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 55. The material caught from side to side</div>
</div>

<p>It will be well to have a needle case to match the
sewing case. Cut a strip of material thirteen inches
long by three and a half inches wide. Cut this
strip in four parts. Get a piece of cardboard that is
not too thick or of such kind that will break easily,
as some of the cheaper grades of brown cardboard
are apt to do. Cut four pieces, three inches wide by
three and a half inches long. Thread your needle
with a piece of No. 40 cotton and put a big knot at
the end. Take one of the pieces of denim and a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
piece of the cardboard. Catch the material from side
to side with stitches about one quarter of an inch
apart (<a href="#Fig55">Figure 55</a>). After sewing these two sides sew
the third and fourth in the same manner. Cover
each piece of the cardboard in this way (<a href="#Fig56">Figure 56</a>).
Take two of the covered pieces and over-cast them
carefully together.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<a name="Fig56"></a><img src="images/i_063.jpg" width="600" height="502" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 56. The four sides of material caught together</div>
</div>

<p>You should have leaves of flannel to stick your
needles in. Pink the edges of the flannel. Pinking
is snipping out the edge in little points and can be
done with scissors. Connect the two pieces of the
needle case with two tiny bows, or a heavy thread
can be made to answer the purpose. The flannel
sheets are tacked through the centre like the pages
in a book (<a href="#Fig7">Figure 57</a>).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>

<p>The third or middle compartment between the
spool case and darning thread can be used for a
miscellaneous pocket to hold the tape-measure,
emery-bag, small scissors and other necessary
articles.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<a name="Fig57"></a><img src="images/i_064.jpg" width="600" height="474" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 57. The flannel sheets tacked through the centre</div>
</div>

<p>A piece of tape stretched down on the denim with
just enough spring for the package of needles to
pass through is a handy way to carry them (<a href="#Fig58">Figure 58</a>).</p>

<p>It is rather dangerous to travel with a pair of
scissors with the points unprotected. In Canada<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
and the states that border it the Indians sell the
little sweet grass protectors. A cork, however,
that comes in small bottles such as you get from drug
stores will protect the points of the scissors as well
as the sweet grass protectors, if not as elegantly.
If the scissors are too large to put in the pocket a
piece of tape could be stitched down to slip them in
lengthwise. The case should be folded in three parts
when it is not in use and a piece of tape the same
colour as the binding tied around it (<a href="#Fig59">Figure 59</a>).</p>

<div class="caption">Fig. 58. The place for the needles</div>
</div>


<p>Now that you have your sewing apron and a work
box, you will love to be sewing every chance you get.
Suppose we plan a set of bed things for Sally Ann.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
First let us make a mattress. The mattress on your
bed is covered, probably, with ticking, but this is too
harsh for your fingers to
sew, so let us select percale
or zephyr, and half-inch
tape for the binding;
the filling can be cotton,
hair, or feathers. If it is
impossible to get any of these three, newspapers
chipped up very fine will make an excellent padding.
Many people use newspaper chippings to fill
pillows for summer use.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<a name="Fig59"></a><img src="images/i_066.jpg" width="400" height="220" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 59. The case folded</div>
</div>

<p>Measure the bedstead and cut two pieces of percale
or zephyr exactly the same size. Now cut a
stripe of the material, one inch wide, long enough to
go around the four sides of one of the pieces of
the material that you have just cut.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<a name="Fig60"></a><img src="images/i_066a.jpg" width="500" height="350" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 60. The narrow strip to the large strip</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>

<p>Baste the long narrow strip around one large piece.
Lay the wrong side of the strip to the wrong side of
the material (<a href="#Fig60">Figure 60</a>). The edges must be
even. Use the combination stitch of one running
stitch and one back-stitch just below the basting.
When the strip has been securely sewed to the four
sides of the material, join the two ends together on
the wrong side.</p>

<p>Now take your tape,
which may be white or
the colour of the figure
in your material, and
bind the edges by first
running one side down
and then the other
(<a href="#Fig61">Figure 61</a>).</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<a name="Fig61"></a><img src="images/i_067.jpg" width="400" height="412" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 61. Binding the mattress</div>
</div>

<p>The other piece of
material is sewed in
the same manner&mdash;the wrong side of the strip to the
wrong side of the material. Do not sew, however,
around the entire four sides but leave about six inches
open through which the filling may be passed. After
basting the strip with combination stitching fill
with cotton or whatever material you have on hand.
Do not fill the mattress so that it will be bumpy.
Put a little stick in and flatten the filling at the top.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
Now sew the opening up and we are ready to quilt
the mattress.</p>

<p>Thread a large needle with two pieces of heavy cotton
floss or wool. Push
your needle through to
the other side, letting a
short end extend above
the mattress. Bring your
needle back again close to
where it came out (<a href="#Fig62">Figure
62</a>). Unthread
the needle and tie the
ends tightly. Cut off
what is left and repeat
again two and a half
inches over. It is best to quilt in rows; that is, to
start two inches in from the long side and make a
row parallel with the tape. The next row is made
two and a half inches farther over and the next row
of knots should come in between the first row of dots.</p>

<div class="caption">Fig. 62. Quilting</div>
</div>

<p>This mattress is made just like yours and the pillow
is the next article we will make. The pillow should
be half the width of your mattress, as we will use two
on the bed. Take a piece of material twice the
length desired for the pillow. Use the same kind of
material as that used for the mattress. Fold the piece<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
in two with the wrong side out. Join the two long
edges and one of the short sides with the
combination stitch (<a href="#Fig63">Figure 63</a>).
Make the stitches one quarter inch
from the edge. Now turn the case
inside out and fill with cotton.
Turn in the edges of the open end
and over-cast them together (<a href="#Fig64">Figure
64</a>). As I have said before,
it will be necessary to make two
pillows.</p>

lawn, cambric or
muslin. Cut the material a little
larger both in length and width
than the pieces used for the pillow.
The seams of the pillowcases will
have to be felled. Along the one
short side and the long side make
fine running stitches, one quarter
of an inch from the edge. Cut the
raw edge from one side so that the
other is about an eighth of an inch
wider. Now fold the wider edge
over like a hem so that it completely covers the
cut edge and hem neatly to the material.   The open<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
end has a wide hem of say three quarters of an inch.
When the hem is finished turn the case with the
work inside.</p>

<p>For the sheets cut two pieces
of muslin or lawn large enough
to cover the mattress and to
turn under. The selvage edge
of the material should run the
length of the sheet. Turn in
a quarter-inch hem on the two
long sides of each sheet and
hem. Now turn a one-inch
hem at the top and bottom of
each sheet. This completes
the sheet (<a href="#Fig65">Figure 65</a>).</p>

<p>A blanket is of course very necessary to have and it
can be made of a piece of an old blanket or of canton
flannel, cashmere, or plain flannel. If a piece of
blanket is used, finish the edges with the blanket
stitch which is described in Chapter twelve of the
book.</p>

<p>The flannel, cashmere, or canton flannel is finished
by turning the edges over a quarter of an inch and
herring boning or cat-stitching them to the material
(<a href="#Fig66">Figure 66</a>). For cat-stitching see diagram in
Chapter nine.</p>

<p>No bed is complete without a counterpane of
some sort and this can be made as fancy as you desire.
A pretty one is made of strips of
insertion joined together by fine
over-casting or fagotting. Fagotting
is explained in Chapter
twenty. A row of edging will have
to be sewed like a ruffle around
the two long and one short sides
to complete the counterpane.</p>

<div class="caption">Fig. 67. The crow's foot and spider on checked gingham</div>
</div>

<p>If a very fancy counterpane is
desired get a piece of checked
gingham of some light colour. The check should
be a quarter of an inch square. With your needle
threaded with white or a shade deeper than the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
darkest check make spiders on the dark squares
and crow's feet on the light. Directions for making
a spider are given in the chapter on "Lace Stitches."</p>

<p>A crow's foot is made by taking one stitch on the
diagonal of the square and two on each side of it,
the stitches on each side of the first one being a trifle
shorter than the previous ones (<a href="#Fig67">Figure 67</a>). A counterpane
like this is very attractive and does not
require a great deal of time to make.</p>

<p>A dainty little pin case that will make an acceptable
little gift for a friend that is going to travel is
the envelope pin case. Take a piece of material
such as linen, cretonne, or silk and another piece of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
different coloured material for lining and shape one
end as shown like the flap of an envelope (<a href="#Fig68">Figure 68</a>).
A good size is nine inches long by four inches wide.</p>

<p>Cut a piece of stiff paper a half inch smaller than
the pieces of material. Baste the material which
will be outside over the paper so that the edges are
folded back one quarter on the paper. Turn a
similar fold on the lining and hem it to the material
as shown on the flap of the envelope opened.</p>

</div>

<p>Now take two papers of pins and place them in
the case so that they look like leaves of a book. Be
careful to see that the heads of the pins are on top.
Now catch the pins to the case with several long
stitches which are taken below the points of the
pins. Stitch a ribbon to flap of envelope and one
at the bottom. Close the case and tie the ribbons
and you have a handy pin case (<a href="#Fig69">Figure 69</a>).</p>

<small>MAKING BUTTONHOLES, CUTTING FROM A PATTERN,
A DOLL DRESS</small></h2>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">To make</span> a good buttonhole is an accomplishment
that any girl can be proud of,
as it is the hardest thing in sewing.
The thread should be almost double in length to
that you usually take, as a joining is very clumsy
in a buttonhole.</p>

<p>A buttonhole is a worked opening in a piece of
material or garment through which a button is to be
slipped. The friction caused by buttoning and unbuttoning
necessitates
that the worked
edges should be firmly
and well sewed.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<a name="Fig70"></a><img src="images/i_074.jpg" width="500" height="385" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 70. The first step in buttonholing</div>
</div>

<p>Before we make a
real buttonhole, let
us see how the stitch
is worked. Draw a
line one inch in length
with the straight of the material. Take two stitches<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
one inch long over this line. At the extreme right
of the stitches insert your needle, threaded with
No. 40 cotton. Take a stitch about a sixteenth of
an inch below the line. While the needle is still
in the material&mdash;you are working from left to
right&mdash;(<a href="#Fig70">Figure 70</a>), carry the thread under its
point from the left, to the right side of the needle.
The enlarged cut showing this stitch is very plain.
The needle is then drawn through the material
toward the chest and then straight from it. The
next stitch and every other stitch must be identical
with the first, the difference being that each stitch
is then a little farther to the left. Every stitch
must be the same length.</p>

<p>Now let us prepare to make the stitch on a fold.
Fold a band in three equal parts. Pass the needle
between the folds and bring it out on the edge.
Hold the end of the thread with the left thumb.
Carry the needle to the back of the fold and insert
the point through the fifth thread of the material
from the edge. The double thread at the edge of
the needle is brought around the point of the needle
from left to right and drawn out. (<a href="#Fig71">Figure 71</a>).</p>

<p>A tailor's buttonhole is made slightly different.
The needle is placed in the same position as in the
ordinary buttonhole. The thread is brought from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
the top of the stitch and the doubled thread is
brought around under the point of the needle from
right to left (<a href="#Fig72">Figure 72</a>).</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<a name="Fig71"></a><img src="images/i_076.jpg" width="500" height="331" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 71. The position of the needle in buttonholing</div>
</div>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<a name="Fig72"></a><img src="images/i_076a.jpg" width="500" height="420" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 72. A tailor's buttonhole</div>
</div>

<p>The corners of the buttonhole are worked in two
ways, either barred or rounded. The round corners
are worked in the same buttonhole stitch, only it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
is twice the depth of the buttonholing along the
two edges. Five or seven stitches will be sufficient
for a corner or the ridge of the buttonholing will
be too crowded.</p>

<p>The bar or braced end of the buttonhole is a
little more difficult. It is necessary to bar a buttonhole
for heavy woollen materials such as men's coats,
or your own cloak, or outer wraps (<a href="#Fig72">Figure 72</a>).
Generally the first end of the buttonhole is rounded
and the last end barred
(<a href="#Fig73">Figure 73</a>).</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 300px;">
<a name="Fig73"></a><img src="images/i_077.jpg" width="300" height="163" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 73. The buttonhole with
one end rounded and the
other barred</div>
</div>

<p>Work around the buttonhole
end when the last stitch
has been made, turn the material
so that the work lies
across your forefinger. Pass the needle over the
extreme left of the stitch, (<a href="#Fig74">Figure 74</a>). Work four
stitches the same length as those of the two
sides of the buttonhole, and then insert
the needle through the ridge of the first
buttonhole stitch. The ridge of the
bar faces the buttonhole. This bar
should be just the width of the buttonhole. Nine
stitches are usually sufficient for it.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 200px;">
<a name="Fig74"></a><img src="images/i_077b.jpg" width="200" height="127" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 74. Barring
the buttonhole</div>
</div>

<p>Tailors run two or three strands at the base of
the buttonhole before working the nine stitches.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
The stitches are not taken through the material but
only over the threads.</p>

<p>A buttonhole is fastened off on the wrong side
at the base of the stitch.</p>

<p>The most important step is to cut the buttonhole
straight. The buttonhole should be a trifle longer
than the button. It should be cut in the opposite
direction to which the strain will be. For instance
on the back of the waist the buttonholes should
run crosswise, for the movement of the shoulders
spreads the buttonhole lengthwise. On the bands
around the waist buttonholes are made lengthwise.</p>

<p>A sharp pair of scissors or a penknife should be
used for cutting the holes. Insert the point of the
scissors or knife through the centre of the buttonhole.
Cut one side, then the other, along a thread
of the material.</p>

<p>The thread is fastened securely on the wrong side
of the left-hand corner. Use No. 40 sewing cotton
for buttonholes, unless on very fine material, when
No. 60 should be used. Sometimes it is well to
over-cast the raw edges before working the buttonhole.
A thread should always start at the extreme
lower left-hand corner.</p>

<p>The backs of yokes should be fastened with loops
and fine buttons. To make a loop, span the thread<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
across the edge of the material in a loop large enough
to slip the button through. Let the last stitch be
on the right-hand side. Now place the threaded
needle under the strands of thread letting the thread
fall under the point of the needle. Repeat in this
manner till the strands are entirely covered. The
ridge or purled edge of this stitch will be on the outside
of the loop.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<a name="Fig75"></a><img src="images/i_079.jpg" width="600" height="242" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 75. Loops made of threads</div>
</div>

<p>Hooks are sometimes caught into loops, but they
are made directly on the material instead of sewed on
the edge. The strands of thread, however, are not
as loose as the buttonloops. The diagram (<a href="#Fig75">Figure
75</a>) of the two loops will convey a clear idea of
how the threads are spanned and covered.</p>

<p>The last step in sewing is cutting from a given
pattern. An old garment that fits well, ripped
apart makes an excellent pattern and requires very
little fitting. Press the pieces before using them as
a pattern. Lay the material so that the selvage
runs lengthwise, that is, from head to foot. Only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
one half of the garment is necessary for a pattern,
as the material is doubled or folded lengthwise
(<a href="#Fig76">Figure 76</a>). The centre front of
the skirt or waist is always placed
on the fold of the material and
either basted or pinned down before
cutting.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 200px;">
<a name="Fig76"></a><img src="images/i_080.jpg" width="200" height="345" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 76. The centre
front on fold</div>
</div>

<p>Collars, cuffs, bands, and sleeves
are cut with the selvage running
their length. Cut any part of a
garment such as sleeves, waist, or
skirt through two thicknesses of
material so that both sides will be
exactly alike. This does not refer to the front gore
of a skirt. When the material has a right and wrong
side the right sides should face each other before
cutting the pattern.</p>

<p>Handkerchiefs or frills should be cut along a
thread so that the edges may be perfectly straight.</p>

<p>Be sure that the material lies perfectly flat under
the pattern. Pin the centre first to keep it from
slipping before pinning the edges. Pin the entire
garment before cutting anything, so that you can
be sure that your material will be sufficient. This
also gives you an opportunity to see where to put
the smaller pieces and economize with the material.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>

<p>A large pair of scissors should be used in cutting.
The blunt-pointed blade is next to the board or table.
It is well to practise on paper and plan the pattern
before using the pattern on the cloth.</p>

<p>Bias bands should be cut on the bias of the material.
Cut a square piece of material and fold it cat-a-corner.
Cut along the fold and you will get a
true bias.</p>

<p>Bands to finish the necks of undergarments or
around armholes should be cut on the bias. In
fact, any curved edge that has to be faced should
be faced with a bias instead of a straight band.</p>

<p>Now suppose we make a real dress for Sally Ann
that will be put together and finished just like one
of your own dresses. The style we will select will
be on the order of a French dress, that is, a long waist
and short skirt. The pattern for the waist is in
seven parts: they are the front, side front, back,
side back, sleeve, collar, and cuff. The skirt is only
one piece.</p>

<p>Three quarters of a yard of material will be sufficient
to make a dress for a doll from eighteen to
twenty inches in height.</p>

<p>In all patterns that are bought only one half is
given; sometimes all the seams&mdash;which are a very
important part of a dress&mdash;are given and sometimes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
they are omitted. Any pattern that is published
by a reliable firm tells on the envelope whether you
should allow for the seams or not.</p>

<p>The pattern is usually of tissue paper and each
piece has perforations or holes of different shapes.
One shape means this side must be placed on the
fold of the material, another shape or perforation
the same shape only grouped differently, means that
the pattern should be placed on a straight thread of
the material. Still another means "gather here."
If there are tucks in the pattern they are usually
indicated. Where the seams join each other, little
notches are made and corresponding notches are
placed together and pinned after the pattern
is cut.</p>

<p>Let us suppose the material is forty-five inches
wide. Place the centre of the skirt on the fold of
the material and pin in place. Your pattern should
be planned and pinned on a flat surface such as a
sewing table. Place the pins through the tissue
pattern and both thicknesses of the material, letting
the head and the point of the pin be visible to the eye.
Do not cut any piece of your pattern until you have
planned and pinned every piece, as that is the only
way you can economize on your material (<a href="#Fig77">Figure
77</a>). Often a pattern cut before each piece is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
planned comes to grief if an over-supply
of material has not been provided.</p>

<p>The centre front is also placed on the
fold of the material as well as the centre,
back and collar. The sleeves are now
fitted in, so that the perforations rest
on the straight thread of the material.
The side front and
back and cuffs are
also pinned to the
material. The
pattern now pinned,
take a large
pair of cutting
scissors and holding
the blunt part
toward the table,
cut close to the
tissue pattern, or
if no seams are
allowed, the width
stated in directions
should be
allowed for the
seams.</p>

</div>

<p>Let us make the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
sleeve first. Take one sleeve and holding with the
right side join notches together (<a href="#Fig78">Figure 78</a>).
Baste the sleeves up on the seams
one eighth of an inch from the edge.
When the basting is finished make a
row of fine running stitches. Turn the
sleeves on the wrong side and baste
them before working the combination
stitches.   The sleeves are now
ready to be banded.   The band is
taken and sewed on the short side.   The seaming
is taken on the wrong side of the material.   A little
seam is taken on each of the long sides of the cuff.
Fold the cuff in half. The turns or folds are opened
out and now turn the cuff inside out.   Run a gathering
thread at the lower edge of the main part of
the sleeves starting the thread one half inch from
each side of the seam.   Place the cuff around the
sleeve so that cuff seam rests on the seam of the
sleeve.   Pin into position.   It will probably be necessary
to pull or adjust the gathering thread so that
the lower part of the sleeve be just the size of the
cuff. Baste the band on after it has been pinned satisfactorily
before working the combination stitch.</p>

<p>Turn the sleeve inside out and fold the cuff in
the creases.   Hem the inner side of the cuff to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
wrong side of the sleeve. On the upper side of the
sleeves run another gathering thread about one
inch and a half from the
seam (<a href="#Fig79">Figure 79</a>). We have
now finished with the sleeve
until the waist proper is
ready.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 300px;">
<a name="Fig79"></a><img src="images/i_085.jpg" width="300" height="392" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 79. Gathering the top of
the sleeve</div>
</div>

<p>Now take the centre back
and side back and baste them
together. Join the pieces so
that the notches correspond.
Work the combination stitch
three eighths of an inch from
the edge. The side fronts
are joined to the backs under the arm and on the
shoulders. The front is then sewed to the right
side of the waist only. It will be necessary to face
the centre front piece and the left side front. Take
a bias strip of material not more than three quarters
of an inch wide and fold an eighth of an inch on each
side of this strip. Join the shoulder seams together,
one side of the back to the right side of the front and
the other side to back. Sew with combination
stitches, then make a felled seam as explained for
the sleeve. Baste the turned fold to the right-hand
side of the waist by opening out creased side and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
placing the two right sides together and stitching
one eighth of an inch from the edge. Turn the
bias over to the wrong side of the waist and slip
stitch. Slip stitching, as I have explained before,
is somewhat like hemming; only the stitches are
taken back of the folded edge and catch one thread
only of the material.</p>

<p>The other bias band is basted in like manner to
the left-hand side of the waist.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 300px;">
<a name="Fig80"></a><img src="images/i_086.jpg" width="300" height="300" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 80. The gathers on the
upper part of the sleeve</div>
</div>

<p>The sleeves are ready to be put in. Measure one
and one quarter inches from
the under arm seam on the
waist, which is the short
seam near the front of the
waist. Pin the seam of the
sleeve to this point. Pin
the rest of the sleeve so
that the gathers are evenly
distributed. Pin the right
side of the sleeve to the
right side of the waist. Baste securely. Remember
that the gathers should be thickest on the
upper part of the sleeve (<a href="#Fig80">Figure 80</a>). Stitch
with fine back-stitching and then overcast. The
neck may be bound or may have the collar attached.</p>

<p>Turn and hem the outer edge of the collar; a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
ruffle of lace may be added if desired. Baste the
collar to the waist, and try the waist on Sally Ann.
If it is a satisfactory fit, stitch in place. It is well
to cover the raw edges with a little bias fold. Hem
the fold down on both sides.</p>

<p>The long strip is not joined, but a half-inch hem
folded on one side and then stitched. The skirt
is plaited or kilted, as it is often called. A hem is
made on each of the short sides of the strips. Now
crease the material as if you were going to make a
tuck three quarters of an inch deep. A box plait
will next have to be planned; again crease your
material as if you were going to make a tuck three
quarters of an inch deep. These creases must be
exactly three quarters of an inch from the double
fold of each piece. Measure an inch and a half,
then turn the material under so that a three-quarter
inch piece is under the left side of the waist line.
This completes the box plait.</p>

<p>The plaits from there on are folded toward the
left, while the first two were toward the right. Baste
each plait down securely. When working on cotton
materials that have a lot of dressing, the creases are
likely to stay in without basting, but while working
on it the edges are apt to get turned up. Basting
(<a href="#Fig81">Figure 81</a>) is therefore the surer and safer way<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
to keep the plaits in position, while for woollen or
soft, sleazy materials it is the only way.</p>

<p>When every plait has been basted lengthwise,
take another thread and baste them crosswise three
or four times.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<a name="Fig81"></a><img src="images/i_088.jpg" width="600" height="298" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 81. Section of plaited skirt showing how it should be basted crosswise</div>
</div>

<p>Join the waist to the skirt, taking care that the
centre of the box-plait is under the direct centre
of the front of the waist.</p>

<p>A sash will be needed to finish this dress. It can
be tacked in place or little straps of ribbon may be
stitched at intervals and the ribbon run through
the straps (<a href="#Fig81A">Figure No. 81A</a>).</p>

</div>

<p>If this dress had been stitched on the machine
it would have been better to make tailored seams
on the waist; that is, a narrow seam is taken on the
wrong side. The material is then turned back so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
that on one side of the seam it slightly overlaps
the other. Baste in place and stitch on the edge.
Tailored seams do not require any extra allowance
of material. They should slant toward the right
on the right side of the garment
and toward the left on
the left side. If the seams
were stitched to run in one
direction the garment would
have a very one-sided appearance.</p>

<p>Press all the wrinkles caused
by handling the dress in
sewing. It is best to lay a
damp cloth over the material
rather than place the iron
directly on the material.
You will need a small iron for
this dress. Press each plait
down carefully. Take out
the basting threads before trying on the dress.</p>

<p>There are good, bad and indifferent dressmakers,
and I know you wish to be one of the former. Sew
a row of buttons on the left front of the dress and
make little buttonholes to correspond on the right
side.</p>

<h2><a name="VI" id="VI"></a>VI<br /><br />
<small>A LESSON IN STENCILLING</small></h2>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">What</span> is stencilling? Let us see. Stencilling
is a branch of painting. Have you heard
the story of the Baltimore belle in the time
of the Revolution who was most anxious to go to
the first big ball that was to be given after the war?
The town had been divested of all the beautiful silks
and satins that the great ladies were accustomed
to wear. Our country had stopped importing these
costly materials because there was no occasion to
use them and no money to pay for them.</p>

<p>An invitation had been sent to one of Baltimore's
fairest daughters who was intending to go with her
cousin. What were they to wear? Both needed
the festive garments. At last, after a careful
canvass of the town, the young man managed to
borrow a pair of satin breeches and a flowered coat
and all the other articles necessary to make a fine
dandy of those days, except the silk stockings.</p>

<p>The girl succeeded in finding a piece of white lawn
of the coarsest kind that was sufficient to make a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
frock. In no way discouraged this clever young
lady, who luckily could paint beautifully, started
and painted little sprays of rose buds on the fifteen
or twenty yards required for the gown. This made
a very dainty and pretty frock.</p>

<p>Poor George, her cousin, was in despair in not
being able to borrow or buy a pair of silk stockings,
but clever Miss Betty hit on the plan of painting
his legs with a thick coat of white and then decorating
them with clocks on each side, so that no one
at the dance even suspected that he didn't have on
silk stockings.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>

<p>Miss Betty's dress was voted to be the most
charming dress of the evening.</p>

<p>Ever since I have heard this story I have wished
that Miss Betty had known how to stencil. What a
lot of time she would have saved! I am sure you
will agree with me when you know how to stencil.</p>

<p>Have you noticed the flat gay decorations above
the moulding in some houses? Well those are
stencilled. A painter will cut out a design from a
thin steel background; he lays this on the wall and
paints over the open spaces in the design. It is
the only true way in which he can keep his pattern.
All free-hand designs are bound to show a difference
in outline.</p>

<p>Stencilling for home decoration is used on curtains
(<a href="#Fig82">Figure 82</a>), porti&egrave;res, rugs, couch covers, table
covers, lunch sets, pillow tops, (<a href="#Fig83">Figure 83</a>), bags,
counterpanes, as well as for dresses, parasols, wraps,
scarfs, and in fact almost every conceivable object
that allows the use of decoration.</p>

<p>You can get a stencil board from any artist supply
shop, but the one you can make at home is cheaper
even if it is not quite as durable.</p>

<div class="caption">A Single Motif Being Used On a Stencilled Scarf</div>
</div>

<p>In many of the schools, stencilling in its simplest
form is taught in the kindergarten. The children are
taught to fold a heavy piece of drawing paper<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
lengthwise and draw half a design so that the centre
of it is on the fold of the paper. The design is then
cut away, leaving the background intact.   This
method is good for very simple motives. Sometimes
when we do not wish our design to be so set, we will
draw it without creasing the paper.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<a name="Fig83"></a><img src="images/i_095.jpg" width="600" height="571" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 83.   A simple stencilled pillow</div>
</div>

<p>The stencil board that you can buy is very hard
for little fingers to cut, besides being expensive.</p>

<p>To make a stencil pattern, draw a design such as
a bunch of violets. Let every petal be separated
from the other and where the stems should intersect<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
leave a little space between. These little spaces
or bridges are what keep the background together.
Of course, as a usual thing, if you buy a stencil outfit,
one pattern or more already cut comes with it.
In many of the large shops stencil patterns can be
bought separately, but if one has any idea of drawing
it is an easy matter to make a pattern.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<a name="Fig84"></a><img src="images/i_096.jpg" width="600" height="367" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 84. The cut stencil</div>
</div>

<p>The design can be traced and cut on a piece of
heavy manilla paper: a coat or two of shellac makes
the paper stiffer and somewhat waterproof. The
advantage of using drawing paper is this, that it
may be cut with a pair of scissors, while a stencil
board requires a sharp penknife and lots of finger<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
strength to cut the pattern. White shellac is the
best to use, as it dries quickly. It can be bought
from any paint store.</p>

<p>The pattern now cut (<a href="#Fig84">Figure 84</a>), you are
ready to do a piece of real stencilling. Let us
choose the cheapest thing we can get for our first
attempt. A piece of cheese cloth for a sash-curtain
appeals to me. Put in the hem so that the stencil
will be sure to be straight. Lay a large piece of
blotting paper over the board or table on which you
are going to work. Place the cheese cloth on top of
that. Try your stencil pattern and measure how
many times you can repeat it. It is better to plan
a pattern with a small space between each motif
so that you will not have half or part of the design
left over. Stick a pin where the centre of each
motif should be.</p>

<p>Lay the stencil pattern in position and thumbtack
it down to the cheese cloth and blotting paper.
Turpentine and oil are the most satisfactory for
stencilling, though there are several patent mixtures
sold that are good. The paint can be mixed with
the turpentine till it is the consistency of a thick
cream or the brush can be dipped into the turpentine
and then into the paint. In either case the brush
must be wiped quite dry, as the process is more of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
a rubbing in one than painting. Bristle brushes of
four different sizes should be in your stencil outfit.
They come round and flat, (<a href="#Fig85">Figure 85</a>). The
frontispiece shows a child stencilling with the round
brush.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<a name="Fig85"></a><img src="images/i_098.jpg" width="600" height="301" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 85. The brushes</div>
</div>

<p>Dip the brush into the mixture and be sure you
wipe it off on a soft rag before painting in the design.
If the brush is too wet the result is a blurred stencil.</p>

<p>Use a different brush for every colour. When the
first motif is stencilled, move the pattern and place it
over the next pin. If you want to reverse the pattern,
clean it thoroughly with naptha on both sides and
let it dry for a couple of minutes before using again.</p>

<p>To make a stencilled piece washable it has to
be steamed like printed dress goods. This can be
accomplished in two ways: that is, by holding it
over a steaming kettle, or by laying a wet cloth over
the stencilling and pressing with a hot iron.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>

<p>Needless to say, a piece stencilled in water colours
should not be treated like this.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<a name="Fig86"></a><img src="images/i_099.jpg" width="600" height="458" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 86. A stencilled bag</div>
</div>

<p>Water colours or crayons can be used when a piece
is not desired to be washed. The latter works in
as smoothly as paints.</p>

<p>Scrim, cheese cloth, linen, crash, burlap, monk's
cloth, and Arras cloth can be used for curtains or
porti&egrave;res. The cost of them varies from seven
cents to one dollar a yard.</p>

<p>Sometimes a small motif is taken and stencilled
all over the material. This gives the effect of a
printed pattern.</p>

<p>Five tubes of paint will produce almost any shade<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
under the sun. They should be blue, yellow, red,
black, and white. Blue and yellow make green;
blue and red, purple; lavender, yellow and red make
orange. A little black will soften the colours while
white lightens the shade. Other combinations can
be made by mixing three colours together. Enough
of the paint should be mixed at one time to stencil
the entire piece, as it is extremely difficult to mix
a new batch of colour that will be the exact shade
as the first. Ultramarine blue is the shade of the
deep sea. Crimson lake is a bright red. Venetian
red is a terra cotta. Emerald green is a blue green.
Sap green is yellow green. Ivory or lamp black are
the two blacks to be had in oil paints; the former
is shiny while the latter is dull. Flake white is
the term for white in oil paints.</p>

<p>Of course, you can buy ready mixed in tubes
almost any shade you desire, but it is lots more fun
to make your own colour combinations, as well as
very much cheaper. Diamond dyes can be used
for stencilling by letting one package of dye serve
for one pint. The dyes will have to be boiled in
the manner stated in their directions.</p>

<p>You will find that stencilling is the most delightful
of the home crafts. Those who are not fond of
needlework will find this a real wholesome pleasure.</p>

<h2><a name="VII" id="VII"></a>VII<br /><br />
<small>WHAT CAN BE DONE WITH ONE SKIN; CUT LEATHER
BAGS, BELTS, BOOK COVERS. ETC.</small></h2>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">There</span> is nothing so handsome for a library
table or cushion in a room of dark rich
colouring as leather work. These articles
are very expensive to buy and are sold in arts and
crafts shops or women's exchanges and some of the
department stores. You have doubtless seen the
dyed whole skin used on a library table, but have you
ever seen leather appliqu&eacute;? That is the design cut
out of a leather background and lined, or pieces of
leather applied to a background.</p>

<p>Different kinds of leather may be used for this
work. The cheapest and thinnest kind is sheepskin.
Leather is usually sold by the square foot and one
has to buy the entire skin. Sheepskin costs about
sixteen cents a square foot; some stores charge more
for it, while it is possible at a wholesale and retail
shop to get it for less. The skins come dyed in all
shades. Golden brown, dull gray or moss green
are the most artistic for general use.   Many tailors<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
like to trim ladies' suits with leather and for this
purpose many beautiful odd shades are dyed. Goatskin
ranks next to sheepskin and is a trifle dearer.
Chamois is good for belts or dainty opera bags.
It comes in white or cream only. Calf is a beautiful
substantial skin, as is also Russia calf. Pebble
calf is what its name implies, very rough with a
glazed finish. The other side presents an undyed
appearance.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<a name="Fig87"></a><img src="images/i_102.jpg" width="600" height="585" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 87. A well-planned skin</div>
</div>

<p>If you get a skin you should not expect to get a
sofa cushion as well as a large table mat out of it.
A skin carefully cut will give you one large piece<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
and the rest of it can be planned for smaller objects,
such as card cases, pen wipers, blotter corners, belts,
picture frames, possibly a magazine cover or a bag.
The diagram of the skin shows how carefully to cut
out and plan every part of it (<a href="#Fig87">Figure 87</a>).</p>

<p>Let us take the sofa cushion first. A bold conventional
design can be used in each corner. One that
has each part separate like a stencil design is one that
I have in mind.</p>

<p>Cut each part out carefully so as not to impair
the background. A cheaper grade of leather of a
tone deeper or lighter can be laid under the design,
though velvet is also in excellent taste for this work.
Broadcloth, satin, and sometimes taffeta are also
used. If a shaded effect is wanted a different
coloured background can be pasted under each different
section of the design. It is a better plan, however,
for the amateur to restrict herself to one
colour for the background as the finishing of different
pieces is no easy problem (<a href="#Fig88">Figure 88</a>). Library
paste is the best means of making the leather
and background adhere, also it does not spot as
mucilage does. The majority of leather workers
consider that the pasting completes the piece, while
others feel that it is necessary to machine stitch
along the extreme edge of the cutting.   Yet again<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
others prefer to work embroidery stitches such as
open buttonhole or couching stitches. Both of
these are explained at length in later chapters.
A pen wiper can be made from a piece cut in circular,
diamond, or triangular shapes. Cut two pieces of
chamois leather the same shape. A plain piece of
the leather also is needed to back the pen wiper.
The chamois pieces serve as leaves on which the pen
is wiped.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<a name="Fig88"></a><img src="images/i_104.jpg" width="500" height="577" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 88. Leather appliqu&eacute; bag</div>
</div>

<p>A card punch will be needed to make a hole through
the four pieces for the ribbon or cord which holds
them together.</p>

<p>It is most necessary to plan the design so that it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
will be appropriate to the object it is to be applied to.
The leather should also harmonize with the colour
of the room or gown with which it is used or
worn.</p>

<p>For those who are anxious to learn how to design,
books on this subject can be obtained from the
public libraries. You should bear in mind, however,
that practice makes all things perfect.</p>

<p>The different methods of applying the design had
better be gone into before we proceed any further.
Thick manilla paper or artist linen may be used on
which to draw the design. The pattern is then
thumb-tacked or pinned on a flat wooden surface,
on the upper edge only, as it will be necessary to
raise the paper off and on during the tracing.</p>

<p>An orange stick such as used for manicuring or
hard pencil will be needed for the tracing. Trace
along the pencilled design with a very heavy pressure
so that there will be an indented line on the leather.
A line once impressed is almost impossible to remove,
so great care must be taken to keep the design true.</p>

<p>Every time you stop tracing there will be a deeper
indentation; for that reason in tracing a curved line
try to draw a full sweep without stopping. A ruler
will be an aid in tracing straight lines.</p>

<p>It may be found necessary to dampen the leather<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
so that the tracing will be distinct. In that case
dampen the entire piece of leather with a wet cloth.
Dampening in sections only causes water rings.
Once the whole leather is dampened, however, it
can be redampened in sections without fear of
marking.</p>

<p>Designs for leather may also be applied by
means of a perforated pattern and a stamping powder
or paste or a transfer pattern may be also used.</p>

<p>The leather for cut-work may be cut with sharp
scissors and manicuring scissors for round or curved
places or two sharp knives of different sizes. A
board of soft wood is the best on which to work.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<a name="Fig89"></a><img src="images/i_106.jpg" width="600" height="93" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 89. A belt of leather of appliqu&eacute; underlaid</div>
</div>

<p>The best kind of paste is one that has been
recommended by a successful leather teacher and
proves satisfactory to all who have tried it. "Bring
to a slow boil a half-pound of flour in two quarts of
water. Add to this mixture when cool, an ounce
of nitric acid and a dram of boric acid and a few
drops of clove oil." The nitric and boric acid, as
well as the clove oil, can be obtained from the drug
store.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>

<p>If knives are used to cut out the design, thumbtack
the leather before commencing.</p>

<p>The paste is applied lightly on the wrong side of
the leather, then the lining placed over it. Lay the
article with the right side up and put it under weights
until it dries. Any surplus paste that may happen
to ooze through can readily be scraped off.</p>

<p>A wide range of articles can be made from leather
appliqu&eacute;, whether underlaid or overlaid, such as
table covers, bags, belts (<a href="#Fig89">Figure 89</a>), medicine
cases, card cases, mirror frames, book or magazine
covers, portfolios, memorandum pads, waste baskets,
pocket books, bill folders, chair covers, besides numerous
other articles.</p>

<p>Sometimes it will be necessary to have two tracings
of the design, one on the leather and one on
the other background. Leather is often applied
to heavy crashes for porti&egrave;res, or pillow tops. A
bold conventionalized poppy is an excellent design
for porti&egrave;res.</p>

<p>Paper is often used to line centerpieces or mats.</p>

<p>Rough tinted cartridge paper can be treated the
same as cut leather and the daintiest of candle or
lamp shades can be made of them. The design is
cut out as in leather and a thin China silk lines the
whole. Each section of the design may then be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
coloured the right shade of the silk. For instance,
a design of cherries can be painted with orange and
red for the cherries and the leaves green, while the
paper is of tobacco brown; a narrow gold braid
finishes the shade at the top and bottom, while the
shade is held together with four tiny gold rivets.</p>

<h2><a name="VIII" id="VIII"></a>VIII<br /><br />
<small>TOOLED LEATHER AND TOOLS NECESSARY</small></h2>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Tooled</span> leather is one of the oldest and most
beautiful of crafts. Instead of weakening
the leather it simply makes it more beautiful.
A handsome box is made of soft wood or cardboard
and covered with tooled or embossed leather
and is a possession that a queen might envy.</p>

<p>Boxes containing tools for leather work can be had
for from five to twenty-two dollars for the outfit.
Twelve tools are in the box. Two modelling tools,
a steel hammer, two embossing tools, a punch, an
embossing ball tool, one cutting or trimming knife,
and four chasing and pearling knives (<a href="#Fig90">Figure
90</a>). Now I know that there are not many of
you who would care to buy an outfit for five dollars,
but for home use there is a simple little article that
can be substituted and yet you can obtain very
satisfactory results. A steel nut pick will work
wonders and then, when you feel that you can do
very much better work with other tools, invest in
a case of them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>

<p>All leathers are not satisfactory for tooling. The
best and most used is Russia calf in a heavy quality.
One skin is usually the least a dealer will sell.</p>

<p>Let us suppose we are working on a card case.
The design is traced in the manner described in the
last chapter, that is, by tracing over the dampened
leather.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<a name="Fig90"></a><img src="images/i_110.jpg" width="600" height="365" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 90. A case of tools</div>
</div>

<p>After the design has been traced remove the paper
and holding the nut pick firmly in your right hand
as you would a pencil, proceed to deepen the lines.
The leather must be kept moist or the tool is apt
to scratch and break the outer skin. It is a work
over which you may become fatigued, but you can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
just lay it aside till the next day and then proceed
again. The deeper the tooled line the handsomer the
piece. It will take several hours to tool a card case.</p>

<p>Another form of decorating leather is with the
little geometrical die that was used so much in
past winters for decorating the background of
etched copper articles (<a href="#Fig91">Figure 91</a>). The little die
is placed on the leather with its raised or embossed
side downward and
one knock from a
steel hammer is
sufficient to make
an imprint on the leather. The entire background
is filled out in this manner. Hammer
with an even pressure otherwise the background
will be bumpy.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 400px;">
<a name="Fig91"></a><img src="images/i_111.jpg" width="400" height="96" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 91. The dies for backgrounds </div>
</div>

<p>Sometimes you may prefer to have your background
pressed or modelled and the design to stand
out in relief. In that case take the bowl or thick
part of the nut pick or modeller and press the background
in flat. If the leather wrinkles when rubbing
it change the direction of working. When the work
is completed it will be noticed that the modelled
part of the leather is darker and quite shiny.</p>

<p>Designs such as cherries, cat-tails, and most floral
forms give a greater opportunity for elaborate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
working. They can be carried out in relief. This
relief is a much more difficult work. In the first
place the design is drawn on the finished surface of
the leather and then, after another sponging with
water, hold the leather up from the table. Holding
the section to be modelled between the first finger
and thumb, work the tool backward and forward
under the section.</p>

<p>Some workers prefer
to hold the working
side toward them, contending
that a greater
pressure can be brought
to bear on a downward
stroke than an upward
one. In that case the
design is stamped or
traced on the wrong side
of the leather.</p>

<p>The oftener the rubbing
is done and the
leather is dampened the
higher the design will
stand forth. The parts
to be worked in relief may be done before the
background (<a href="#Fig92">Figure 92</a>).</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 348px;">
<a name="Fig92"></a><img src="images/i_112.jpg" width="348" height="600" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 92. A magazine cover</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span></p>

<p>To keep the leather from falling back to its natural
shape some workers paste the relief parts. My
teacher used a paste that we found quite stiff enough
except for large heavy objects.</p>

<p>To make this paste an ounce of dextrin is left
soaking in water for about sixteen hours. Dextrin,
by the way, is the only paste which will not stain
silk. It is a white powder, and when used as a paste
can be dissolved in boiling water till it is the consistency
of a thick cream. When used as a modelling
wax, however, it requires to be thicker than a cream.
After the dextrin is dissolved mix in a pint of scrap
leather that has been grated to shreds, and a few
drops of turpentine. The scrap leather thickens the
paste while water thins it.</p>

<p>Before applying the paste to the leather the raised
side is placed face downward upon the marble.
Take some of the paste and press it into the hollow
places until they are entirely filled. After every
space has been filled lay a piece of paper over them
and then a cardboard or a piece of board large
enough to cover all the design.</p>

<p>Turn the leather, paper, and board right side up
on the working table. While the places are being
filled in the design is apt to be pushed a little out of
shape. With the finer modelling tool or your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
nut pick go over the flattened places again. Let
the work remain on the table for four days without
touching it so that it may be thoroughly dried.</p>

<p>Sometimes you will see a beautiful tinted leather.
This is usually done by the means of dyes, or
chemicals. For the amateur the former is recommended.
The dye is applied to the leather with
soft cotton or a sponge. To deepen the shade wet
the places desired to be darker two or three times
with the dye.</p>

<p>To obtain the brightly polished appearance so
often seen in a handsome piece of leather rub the
piece with your bare palms. A little wax rubbed on
your hand greatly aids the work.</p>

<p>In all leather work it is necessary to leave a margin
about a half inch at least.</p>

<p>Another paste which may be substituted for the
formula given in this chapter is one made of equal
parts of sawdust and rye flour with water.</p>

<p>The cutting or shaving knife that comes with the
outfit is good for cutting the leather. If a deeper
indentation is desired than is obtained by tracing
the pattern, a slight slit may be made with the
shaving knife. Of course cutting the leather weakens
it and it should only be done on a very heavy piece
of skin.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>

<p>The hammer is indispensable for stamping in
the little dies. These dies are not usually included
in the outfit.</p>

<p>The difference between the modelling (Figures
<a href="#Fig93">93</a> and <a href="#Fig94">94</a>) and embossing tools is that the embossing
tools are a greater aid in achieving fine bas-relief
work. The embossing ball tool is used to make the
deep indentations.</p>

</div>

<p>The punch is to make holes for rivets or through
which cords or ribbons may be passed to connect
two or more pieces of leather together as on a pad
or book. The punch and pearling knives are used
in fine carved leather. As one becomes proficient
in the art of simple leather work she is tempted
to branch out and try more elaborate work. A
great many books have been written on this subject
which, though perhaps puzzling to a beginner, will be
interesting and invaluable if the work is taken up as a
serious occupation. The best specimens of this work
can be seen at the different arts and crafts exhibitions.</p>

<small>THE SIMPLEST STITCHES IN EMBROIDERY&mdash;CHAIN
STITCHING, OUTLINING, HERRING-BONING, CROSS-STITCHING,
SOUTACHE, CORONATION BRAIDING</small></h2>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">It would</span> be hard indeed to say just how many
stitches there are in embroidery, as so many
are combinations of the others. The ones you
will hear about are the simplest ones.</p>

<p>Some years ago I had a large class in embroidery
in a mission school. Every seat was taken and
many applicants were refused admittance. The
supervisor came in one day and said that there was
a little girl who was very anxious to join the class
and that she knew how to sew. I did not have the
heart to refuse her, so in marched little Nellie. She
was just seven years old and said that she attended
sewing school every Saturday at her church and that
her teacher had taught her <i>all</i> about embroidery.
I gave her a little stamped design and told her to
chain-stitch it and let me see how well she could do
it. About five minutes later I happened to turn
around and there was little Nellie frantically waving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
her hand. "Teacher, teacher," she said, "that is the
only stitch the Lady didn't show me."</p>

<p>Now, as I am most anxious that nothing like that
will happen to you, I will start with chain-stitching
as the simplest stitch (<a href="#Fig95">Figure 95</a>). It is also one of
the oldest stitches in embroidery. Every museum
that exhibits embroidered articles will have some
elaborate designs carried out in fine chain-stitching.
If the stitches are worked in filo silk or spool silk
the effect is like machine work.</p>

<div class="caption">Fig. 95. Chain-stitching, showing how
to turn a corner</div>
</div>

<p>Draw a straight
line on a piece of
muslin and thread
your needle with a
piece of red cotton.
No knots should be
used in embroidery.
Fasten the thread
by taking three fine
running stitches and one back stitch to insure firmness
at the end of the line. Now with the needle
in position at the beginning of the line, start by
taking a straight stitch on the line. Bring the
thread under and pull the needle through the
material. You have made the first loop. Put
your needle back into the last hole or as near as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
possible to it, take another stitch on the line, repeat
until you come to the end of the design.</p>

<p>Take the same length stitch every time or you
will not have a good-looking chain. If you will
look at the links in your chain bracelet, you will see
that every link is the same size as the others. Suppose
you wanted to chain-stitch a square or a triangle:
when you come to the corner do not try to make one
continuous line, but carry the needle down through
the material at the end of the loop to fasten the link
and start the next row at right angles to it. Chain-stitching
can be put to many uses. It is a pretty
stitch to cover a single line in a conventional design.
It is also the quickest kind of padding for large
designs. When it is used as a padding, the rows are
worked close to each other. If the work is to be
raised very high, the chain-stitching may be placed
in rows one on top of the other. You will, however,
hear more about padding in a later chapter.</p>

<div class="caption">Fig. 96. Smooth outlining</div>
</div>

<p>The next stitch we will talk about is the outlining,
(<a href="#Fig96">Figure 96</a>). Some people think it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
simpler than chain-stitching. It was the first
stitch I learned in embroidery, but it is not as pretty
as chain-stitching. The first thing I did in fancy
work when I was nine years old was a wonderful
face cloth with a wild rose on the top, and under it
my name and the motto, "<i>Cleanliness is Next to
Godliness</i>," worked in red cotton. After that I
made face cloths for every member of the family.</p>

<p>Outlining makes one think of plain sewing. There
are two kinds of outlining, rough (<a href="#Fig97">Figure 97</a>)
and smooth, the difference being in how the
thread is thrown. To make the rough outline, fasten
the thread as directed in
chain-stitching and on the
line take a stitch about an
eighth of an inch. Then work from left to right.
Let the thread fall under the needle and be sure
to keep it this way. A smooth outline is made
by throwing the thread over the needle instead of
under it; this outline can be used as stems for
flowers unless a more elaborate kind is desired.</p>

<p>Either chain-stitching or outlining is an excellent
way to decorate bureau scarfs, pillow tops, or table
covers.</p>

<p>Herring-boning is used for finishing seams on a
flannel skirt, or it may be used above hems. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
little flannel skirt you intend to make for Sally Ann
this winter should be finished in this way. Here is a
stitch for which we do not need guide lines, though
while you are learning, the lines might be helpful.
Draw two parallel lines a quarter of an inch apart.
Take a stitch on the upper line, about an eighth
of an inch long. Then make one on the lower line,
letting the thread fall always to the right. When
you have made a row between with the lines, try to
work one without lines and see if you can keep the
herring-boning straight (<a href="#Fig98">Figure 98</a>).</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">

<div class="caption">Fig. 98. Herring-boning or cat-stitching</div>
</div>

<p>A plain quilt or cover for the baby can be made
very attractive, by working herring-boning around
the edge. If the cover is woollen, use worsted or
heavy silk for the stitchery, but if it is cotton material,
a heavy lustre is recommended. The needle
to use depends on the thread. A sewing needle
will carry a round cotton thread such as D. M. C.,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
Madonna, Utopia, Royal Society, or Peri lustre.
A crewel needle, which is a needle with a long eye,
will be required for silk or worsted. An easy way
to thread a No. 2 or No. 4 crewel needle with worsted
is to hold the needle in the left hand and double
the thread at one end and run the needle through
it. Hold the thread between the thumb and first
finger of the right hand so that the thread is just
visible. Gently pull the needle out with the left
hand and run the doubled thread through the eye.
It sounds a great deal harder than it actually is, but
it will require very little practice.</p>

<div class="caption">Fig. 99. The first step in cross-stitching</div>
</div>

<p>When you went to kindergarten did you have little
pierced cards on which you made designs in coloured
silks or cottons?   Well they had these at my school<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
and we made book-marks, needle-books and all
sorts of funny little things. If you remember the
cross-stitching of the kindergarten days, regular
cross-stitching will be a simple matter. The nicest
material for this work is Java canvas, which is very
coarse and stiff. It is ideal for book covers or napkin
rings. The holes in the canvas are so large that
working on it is almost like play. As Java canvas
is rather expensive you will find a coarse scrim a
good substitute. A lot of boys that I once knew
took up this work very enthusiastically, so simple
is it.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<a name="Fig100"></a><img src="images/i_122.jpg" width="600" height="315" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 100. The second step in cross-stitch</div>
</div>

<p>Do you know that you can make a gingham apron
for mother and decorate it with cross-stitching that
will last ever so long? Get a piece of gingham with
squares about an eighth of an inch. Cross-stitch it
in a shade darker than the gingham or in white or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
red. The stitches are taken on the diagonal as
shown in the diagram (Figures <a href="#Fig99">99</a> and <a href="#Fig100">100</a>). If
there is a great deal of cross-stitching to be done,
the quickest way is to make all the stitches that run
in one direction first, and then come back and cross
them. Perhaps mother has a small piece of cross-stitching
that you can use as a model. Simple
triangles are easy to make. Begin the lower row
with an uneven number, such as seven, nine, eleven,
or thirteen. The next row make two stitches less,
dropping one from each end, and so on till you have
one at the top.</p>

</div>

<p>Now suppose that you had a little linen or silk<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
bag on which you would like to have a cross-stitch
design, yet this material is not coarse enough for
you to use as a guide for the cross-stitching. Do
not think you cannot do it, for I will show you a
way. Get a piece of scrim just as coarse as you can
find, and baste it over the place you would like to
cross-stitch. Work the design on it and when the
cross-stitching is all finished pull out the scrim
thread by thread. Sometimes you will have to snip
the thread of the scrim if your needle accidentally
gets caught in them. (Figures <a href="#Fig101">101</a>, <a href="#Fig102">102</a>,
and <a href="#Fig103">103</a>.)</p>

<div class="caption">Fig. 103. Another cross-stitch design</div>
</div>

<p>A very simple thing to do is to braid a dress for
yourself. Now that all the large pattern houses
are carrying transfer patterns you can get a design<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
for braiding very cheap. A little girl I know braided
a dress for herself and one for her mother last summer.
She used light blue chambray and braided
it with white. There are several kinds of braid, but
the easiest to use is soutache, whether it is cotton
or silk. It is a flat braid and varies in width from
one to three eighths of an inch.   First stamp your
design on the material, or if you have not a transfer
pattern you can draw a design on tissue paper, making
it as long as required and then baste the paper
in right position on your dress. Take a stiletto,
which is a little tool somewhat like a nail that is
used in embroidery for piercing holes, and punch
a hole on the line.   Push one end of your braid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
through this and fasten the end of it on the wrong
side of your material. Thread your needle with
sewing cotton or silk the colour of the braid and sew
it down with little running stitches and an occasional
back-stitch to fasten it firmly. When you come to
the end of the line or of the braid, carry the end
through as at the beginning and fasten.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<a name="Fig103A"></a><img src="images/i_126.jpg" width="600" height="186" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 103A. A fourth design in cross-stitch</div>
</div>

<p>Coronation braid is beautiful, but oh, so very
much harder to sew on than flat braid. There are
two ways that coronation braid may be sewed on.
The one that I give preference to is stamping the
design on the wrong side of the material and holding
the braid on the right. A stiletto hole is made on
the line and the end of the braid brought through
to the back and fastened securely so there will be
no likelihood of its slipping. Then, holding the
braid with the left hand, connect it to the material
from the wrong side with fine running stitches. The
stamped line on the wrong side will serve as a guide<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
for the stitches. You can feel every time the needle
touches the braid. Now perhaps many of you are
wondering what coronation braid is. It is a braid
that looks like fat grains of rice all strung together.
There are different sizes of the braid, varying from
the quarter inch to the three quarters of an inch size.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<a name="Fig104"></a><img src="images/i_127.jpg" width="600" height="72" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 104. Coronation braid</div>
</div>

<p>The second way to sew it on is from the right side
with little slip stitches. At the small end it would
be wise to take a stitch over the braid to hold it
firmly. Centre pieces, bureau-scarfs or even towel
ends are handsome when decorated with coronation
braid, and do you know it is a very easy matter to
make designs for yourself, as there is nothing prettier
than daisies or wild roses for coronation braid. If
the petals are too fine to allow you to use the coronation
braid, then you must use one grain for each
petal, cutting off the grains as you require them.</p>

<p>Coronation braid comes in white, Delft blue,
bright green, or red. The braid is supple enough to
turn sharp corners.</p>

<p>The daisy, as I have stated before, is one of the
principal designs used for coronation braid.   Braid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
the flower with one piece of the braid. It is not
necessary to cut the braid but at the beginning and
the ending of the daisy. The very largest width
of coronation braid will be required for the daisy.
Two grains will be sufficient for a petal. Bring
the narrow ends to the centre and connect them to
the material. In the centre make a cluster of French
knots. The effect produced is a daisy embroidered
heavily and yet quite different from satin stitch.
(<a href="#Fig105">Figure 105</a>.)</p>

<p>A belt decoration with five or six coronation daisies
is very attractive when used on a light summer
dress. Sometimes the owner prefers to couch the
braid down with blue cotton and to work the centre
of the daisy in the same colour.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">

<div class="caption">Fig. 105. A daisy in coronation braid</div>
</div>

<p>A row of daisies is improved by working a fagotting
stitch which is explained in "Simple Lace<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
Stitches," between the petals. See that the braid is
sewed on far enough apart that the lace stitches will
not be crowded.</p>

<p>Coronation braid is also used with crochet stitches
for the borders of centre pieces and towels.</p>

<small>SMOCKING, FEATHER-STITCHING AND LAZY-DAISY
STITCH</small></h2>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Smocking</span> is such a fashionable trimming this
year that I am sure you will not be contented
till Sally Ann has a smocked dress. Why,
one cannot take a walk in the park without seeing
several little children and some grown-ups, too,
wearing smocked dresses. Sometimes they are made
of fine lawn or pique and then again they are China
silk, cr&ecirc;pe de chine, or cashmere.</p>

<p>Stamped patterns can be had for smocking but
they are not at all necessary. Nearly every little
English girl knows how to smock without buying
a pattern and why should not you?</p>

<p>The simplest form of smocking is the honeycomb
or diamond (<a href="#Fig106">Figure 106</a>). It can be any size you
wish. A good size for Sally Ann's dress is the
half-inch diamond smocking. The beauty of the
work lies in its regularity. To keep it so, the dots
must be spaced evenly. A good way is to have
a marking card.   Take a piece of heavy paper or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
thin cardboard about six inches long by an inch
and a half wide. With a ruler draw a faint line
one half inch down parallel with the long edge of
the card. Draw four other lines below this at quarter-inch
intervals. Be sure that the space between
each two lines is a quarter inch, no more or no less.
Along the top line measure in one half inch. From
this point make dots at quarter-inch intervals all
the way across. Each line is dotted in like manner,
letting each dot come directly under the upper
one in straight rows. If mother has a card punch
ask her to lend it to you and where the dots are make
holes. A stiletto will answer the same purpose
as the punch; or an orange stick may be pressed
into service. Your marking card is now ready.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<a name="Fig106"></a><img src="images/i_131.jpg" width="500" height="353" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 106. Diamond smocking</div>
</div>

<p>Measure the length you wish to make Sally Ann's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
skirt. Select a piece of material that will show
pencil marks, such as lawn, pique, China silk, or
cr&ecirc;pe de chine. It will not be necessary to gore the
skirt, as the smocking will form a sort of yoke for
the dress. A little frock smocked in blue or red will
be nice enough for all occasions. Take the material
and smooth all the creases out after it is cut the right
length. You must allow about the same amount of
material for the width of the hem as you do for ordinary
skirts. Place the smocking card so that the
edge of it is on a line with the top edge of the goods.
The smocking must be done before the belt is put
on. Through each of the perforated holes make a
dot in lead pencil. After every hole has been dotted,
move the card so that there is only one quarter of
an inch space before commencing to dot again. In
other words, place the card so the dots have the appearance
of being one continuous design.</p>

<p>Thread a No. 6 sewing needle with a piece of red
or blue cotton. Make a tiny knot at the end.
Start from the topmost left-hand dot from the under
side of the material. Draw the first and second
dots together. Three stitches on the right side will
suffice to hold them together. Between the second
and third dots let the thread span the material on the
wrong side without pulling it. The third and fourth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
dots are drawn together and then the thread spans
the space between the fourth and fifth. Do you
see how we are working? First a dot, then a space,
a dot, then a space, until the entire line is finished.</p>

<p>The second row is worked exactly the same only
instead of starting on the first dot of the second row,
start with the second. The third row corresponds
with the first and now at last we have formed a
diamond.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<a name="Fig107"></a><img src="images/i_133.jpg" width="400" height="459" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 107. Smocking in points</div>
</div>

<p>If a little more colour
is wanted than just
the dot alone, pass a
thread along the edge
of each diamond under
the dots. A suggestion
which may prove
helpful to you if the
material has starch in
it is that it is easy
to crease each line of
dots before starting to smock. If the material is
soft the smocking should be stroked or gauged.
There is a new term to learn, "gauge." It is the
same as stroking in sewing. The English women
have all sorts of complicated patterns in smocking,
but the one that is most popular is the diamond<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
smocking I have told you about. After you know
the principle you can make the smocking as deep as
you wish and then try and smock in points. (See
<a href="#Fig107">Figure 107</a>.)</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 200px;">

<div class="caption">Fig. 108. Single
feather-stitching</div>
</div>

<p>Feather-stitching is almost as simple as smocking.
It has various other names. Perhaps you know
it by the name of "brier-stitch." The first and
simplest form is the single feather-stitching. A
thread as fine as No. 60 sewing cotton or a heavy
Germantown wool can be used for it.
Baby blankets or a blanket for yourself
are pretty feather-stitched in wool.</p>

<p>Like smocking, patterns can be had
for feather-stitching. But the best
embroiderers never use
them, as their mechanical
correctness makes the
work too much like machine
work. I do recommend,
however, a faint line drawn so as
to have something on which to guide
your line and gauge your stitches.</p>

<div class="caption">Fig. 109. Double
feather-stitching</div>
</div>

<p>Let us thread our needle with a piece
of coarse blue thread. On a little piece
of muslin draw a faint pencil line across it. Commence
from the upper right-hand side of the line.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
Take a short stitch about three sixteenths of an inch
on the right of the line, slanting to the line. Let the
thread come under the point of the needle in each
stitch. The second stitch is taken on
the left side of the line the same distance
over and the same in slant (<a href="#Fig108">Figure
108</a>).</p>

<div class="caption">Fig. 111. Four on each

</div>

<p>Double feather-stitching is two
stitches to the right, two to the left
and so on till the line is finished (<a href="#Fig109">Figure
109</a>). In fact you can make three,
four (Figures <a href="#Fig110">110</a> and <a href="#Fig111">111</a>), or five
stitches or even more if you wish on
each side. The prettiest little border can be made
of feather-stitching in circles. Take
a quarter or a fifty-cent piece and
draw a faint line around it on the
material about one inch from the
edge. Move the piece till it overlaps
the pencilled circle and draw
another circle. Repeat as many
times as necessary to go around the
skirt, sleeve, or section you are
decorating. A row such as this
makes a pretty decoration around the sleeves and
neck of a night dress or the ruffles of drawers.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
Marking cotton No. 20 or No. 25 should be used
for feather-stitching underwear.</p>

<p>Infants' dresses, bibs, or petticoats of lawn or
any very sheer material of cotton or linen should
be worked in fine marking cotton, either Nos. 25, 30,
40, or 50.</p>

<p>Just a word about threads. There are several
different kinds. The most popular and best known
are D. M. C., Madonna, Royal Society, and Utopia.
The numbers run about the same. Some teachers
recommend one certain kind, but the result obtained
from using any of them is almost identical.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 150px;">
<a name="Fig112"></a><img src="images/i_136.jpg" width="150" height="518" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 112. Seaweed-stitch</div>
</div>

<p>There is a pretty little stitch that can be made
with a foundation of double feather-stitching.
We used to call it "seaweed-stitch"
when we were youngsters. I
remember I made a white cashmere coat
for my doll and used the seaweed-stitch
along the hem and above the opening,
and on the cuffs and collar of the coat.
It was embroidered in rose coloured filo
silk. A row of double feather-stitching
was worked in the usual way. At the
end of each stitch a little Van Dyke
point or V was worked. Try it yourself and see
how dainty it is (<a href="#Fig112">Figure 112</a>).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span></p>

<p>A good way and something new for decoration is
the feather-stitchery used like festoons on the hems.
The way this is done is to take a compass and make
a circle about two and a half inches in diameter.
Cut it out in heavy paper or thin cardboard. Baste
the hem in place and then trace one-third of the
circle. Repeat in like manner till the hem has the
appearance of large scallops. Along the lines work
the single or double feather-stitching in No. 20
marking cotton through the two thicknesses of the
material. Pull out the basting threads from the
hem and then carefully cut away the material
within each scallop on the wrong side of the hem.
In other words, the upper part of the under hem is
cut close to the stitching. Cut right down to the
feather-stitching.</p>

<p>Only thin materials are pretty worked like this,
as the doubled material gives a milk-white appearance,
while the upper or single parts are transparent.
A lazy-daisy stitch worked in the centre of each
scallop adds further beauty to a feather-stitched hem
such as has been just described. The lazy-daisy
has been aptly called because it requires a stitch
to connect each petal to the material.</p>

<div class="caption">Fig. 113. The lazy-daisy stitch</div>
</div>

<p>Another name for this lazy-daisy stitch is the
"bird's-eye" stitch (<a href="#Fig113">Figure 113</a>).   It is used to represent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
clovers, daisies, or leaves. The stitch is
made, if for a daisy, from a common centre. Bring
your needle up from the
centre of the daisy and
take a stitch the length of
the petal. Let the thread
come from the left under
the point of the needle.
Pull the needle through the
material on the right side.
A short stitch at the end
of the petal catches it
down to the material. The needle is now brought
back to the centre and the next petal made in the
same manner. Any size daisy can be made like
this from the quarter to a two-inch size. Remember
that the larger your daisy is the more petals it should
have. As fine thread should be used for the little
flowers and the heaviest silk or lustre for the big
ones, it is a wise plan to faintly mark in pencil the
daisy. One line will be sufficient for each petal.
If you do this, you can then be sure that each petal
will be the same length as the last.</p>

<p>A charming little yoke can be made of groups
of fine tucks and rows of the daisies.</p>

<h2><a name="XI" id="XI"></a>XI<br /><br />
<small>COUCHING, SHADOW WORK AND TURKISH STITCH<br />
HOW TO STAMP DESIGNS</small></h2>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">The</span> more one does of fancy work the more
fascinating it becomes.   Every new piece
presents an opportunity for new stitches
and colours.</p>

<p>We have talked a lot in the first chapters of this
book as to the different implements necessary for
sewing and by now I am sure you have a well-equipped
sewing box or basket. Now it will be
necessary to add considerably to your work box
for embroidery.</p>

<p>The crewel needle which I mentioned in the ninth
chapter is the most important implement. Get
a pack of assorted Nos. from 5 to 10. They will
answer every purpose unless you need a large
tapestry needle for couching. The most unfortunate
thing about a crewel needle is that the eye has the
bad habit of breaking. This is caused from the
steel being so fine at the top that vigorous working
snaps it off very quickly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span></p>

<p>A tapestry needle is like a large crewel needle,
only it is much stronger and the eye is very large.</p>

<p>A stiletto of ivory, bone, or steel should also be
in your box. An orange stick can be substituted
for a stiletto in case of emergency.</p>

<p>A small pair of scissors, too, should be included
to cut the ends of silks or pare away the material
after buttonholing or making an eyelet.</p>

<p>I have kept the most important till the last.
That is the embroidery hoop or rings. Really
you would be surprised to see how many different
kinds there are in this world. First there are the
black celluloid ones that have their good points, but
they do not stretch over the material. Then there
are the common wooden ones that have sharp edges
that catch and fray the silk on every turn. There
are some wooden ones that have a felt lining and
whose edges are an improvement on the cheaper
kind, but they also do not stretch over thick fabrics.
The kinds that have a spring and may be adjusted
to any size desired have their advantage, but the
spring catches the silk also and of course that will
never do for fine work. The simplest, best, and
cheapest kind is the pair that is made at home.
Get two pairs of the cheapest rings, even if their
edges are rough. One pair should be small enough<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
to set inside of the other. They vary from the
smallest to the largest circular kind, each one setting
inside of the other. Select two pairs that come next
in size to each other. The most convenient size
and ones that can be used for all kinds of work are
the six inch. Take the larger hoop of each pair for
your work. Now cut a piece of canton flannel in
half-inch strips, or if mother has the coloured selvage
left from a piece of flannelette, get that. The
largest hoops should be wound over and over like
the hoops they use in schools for fancy drills. The
other hoop should be padded before winding it.
To pad, lay strips two or three thicknesses deep
around the hoop and then wind thickly like the
other hoop. Hoops like these never leave marks
on the material, as often happens with the celluloid
or wooden hoops. Another point is that the sheerest
material, such as chiffon, can be used in them, while
if a heavy burlap or crash is embroidered over them
a little of the winding strips can be removed for the
time being.</p>

<p>There are other things you might find handy for
your box, but it is no use getting them till you have
occasion to use them.</p>

<p>Now we are ready to make use of some of the things
just described. The tapestry needle will be brought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
into use for our next stitch, which will be couching.</p>

<p>It is a beautiful old stitch that is often used as an
outline. It can be made as a heavy thick cord, or
yet again it need only be the size of a fine string.
The expression is often used, "Couch a cord on."
Cord is used instead of threads and lustre on pieces
where only the effect is wanted.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<a name="Fig114"></a><img src="images/i_142.jpg" width="600" height="292" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 114. Couching</div>
</div>

<p>To couch with a number of silk or lustre threads
select a No. 2 tapestry needle. Cut the skein of
silk so that you will have the longest length of thread
possible. Thread your needle with all the strands
in the skein, if the eye will carry them. Make a
stiletto hole in the cloth on the line of the design.
Bring the tapestry needle through to the back
(<a href="#Fig114">Figure 114</a>).</p>

<p>A crewel needle is threaded with a single strand
of silk, the same shade or lighter or darker if you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
desire. Fasten the silk ends down neatly on the
back of the material with the single thread and
bring it up one quarter of an inch from the hole and
span the cluster of silk threads. The threads are
caught down in this manner at quarter-inch intervals.
When the end of the line is reached, the cluster
of threads is again taken through to the back of the
material.</p>

<p>Couching is a stitch that you will hear more about
in later chapters.</p>

<p>The Turkish or Ismet stitch
is another name for cat-stitching
or herring-boning. See <a href="#Fig98">Figure
98</a>. The stitch is taken
vertically instead of horizontally,
as in cat-stitch. Turkish
stitch gets its name from the embroideries
from Turkey (<a href="#Fig115">Figure 115</a>). It seems to be the
favourite stitch of the Turkish ladies.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 300px;">
<a name="Fig115"></a><img src="images/i_143.jpg" width="300" height="286" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 115. Turkish stitch</div>
</div>

<p>Have you ever noticed how many pieces of Turkish
embroidery are worked on coarse unbleached muslin
or tan linen? The colours are generally bright
green, blue, coral pink, chestnut brown, purple and
then outlined in black or gold thread.</p>

<p>Shadow work, is not that a funny name for embroidery?
But you can understand why it is called<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
that when you see a piece worked. It gives the appearance
of a design under the cloth, as all the
stitches are taken from the wrong side of the material.
The design is drawn or stamped on the wrong side.
Lawn is usually selected for the background of
shadow work because of its transparency. A heavy
cotton such as No. 16 or No. 20 marking cotton or
D. fine lustre is necessary.</p>

<p>Daisies or chrysanthemums are most popular
for shadow work on account of the smoothness on
their edges. Not that it is impossible to work
an indented edge, but it is more difficult.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 300px;">
<a name="Fig116"></a><img src="images/i_144.jpg" width="300" height="266" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 116. The right side of
shadow stitch</div>
</div>

<p>To work the shadow
stitch, place your work
over your embroidery
hoop with the design side
up. Start to work a
petal from the heart of
the flower. Do not use
a knot. The stitch is
like cat-stitching (see
<a href="#Fig98">Figure 98</a>). First you take a stitch on one side
of the petal, then you pass over to the other side.
Be sure you take the same length stitch every time.
The stems are worked in outline stitch. Shadow
work from the right side looks like back-stitching<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
(<a href="#Fig116">Figure 116</a>). It is used on aprons, shirtwaists, or
bureau scarfs where a good effect is wanted with
very little work.</p>

<p>There are two ways of working the leaves of
daisies or chrysanthemums in shadow work: First,
and the best in my opinion, is to start and work
from the top of the leaf to where the midrib commences
in the design. Now work from the midrib
to the outer edge on the right side of the leaf. The
left-hand side is yet to be filled in. Start from the
base of the leaf and instead, however, of putting
the needle through the material by the midrib
catch one thread upon the midrib and then take
a stitch on the left-side edge of the leaf, up to where
the midrib ends.</p>

<p>The other way of working a leaf is to outline the
midrib first. Then start from the base of the leaf
and work across the entire leaf. The former way
is the better, because there is not such a wide
stretch of thread on the wrong side as in the latter
method.</p>

<p>Batiste, organdy, and lawn are the usual materials
used in America for shadow work, but in England,
where more substantial materials are generally
liked, tea cloths of linen in shadow stitch are often
seen. Tiger lilies are good for any large piece.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span></p>

<p>The effect of shadow work on linen is as if a padded
design was placed on the material.</p>

<p>White is the nicest for working shadow stitch on
waists, especially as colour is apt to cheapen the effect.</p>

<p>Remember that a design drawn out in pencil soils
the cottons or silks and necessitates the article being
washed before it is used. You can buy patterns
for embroidery so cheap and in such excellent
taste that it pays one in the end to use them instead
of drawing on the material. There is the perforated
design that can be had from five cents up. It is the
oldest and in some ways the most expensive pattern.
The perforated paper is laid, with the rough side
up, over the material on the ironing table or any other
flat surface. An especially prepared powder that
embroidery shops sell for stamping designs is the
best to use. A pouncet is several layers of felt rolled
together, or a piece of wood covered with felt.
Rub the pouncet in the powder. See that the pattern
is weighted down so that it will not slip while
you are working on it. Rub the powder in with a
circular movement. Lift the weights from the
lower edge of the paper, and gently raising the
pattern see that the design is well on before removing
the pattern. A hot iron will be necessary now to
set the powder. Every time you use the iron just<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
clamp it down on the design. Wipe it off on an
old piece of cloth before you press it again on another
section of the design. Each time the iron touches
the powder, part of it adheres to the iron and the
design would be spoiled if the iron was used again
before wiping it. After the design has been set,
the iron can be used freely over the whole work.</p>

<p>There is another method of stamping with a
perforated pattern, and that is placing the smooth
side of the design face upward and using a blue paste
that comes in cake form. The pouncet is dipped in
kerosene or naptha and then rubbed on the paste.
Apply to the paper as directed for the powder. This
method requires no iron, but care must be taken not
to get the pouncet too wet or the design will run.</p>

<p>A third method for stamping is one that requires
to be rubbed with the back of a spoon. The fourth
and newest method of stamping is by the transfer
designs. The patterns are in different colours.
Place the transfers with the bright or raised surface
next to your material and press with a heated iron.
Some patterns require a very hot iron, while for
others a moderately heated iron suffices.</p>

<p>You can make a perforated pattern yourself by
drawing a design on a piece of paper and using a
sewing machine to perforate along the lines.</p>

<h2><a name="XII" id="XII"></a>XII<br /><br />
<small>BUTTONHOLING AND WALLACHIAN EMBROIDERY</small></h2>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Embroidery</span> buttonholing is a little different
from the buttonhole stitch used in
sewing. It is a stitch that is most used
to finish the edges of centre pieces, scarfs, and, in
fact, any article where embroidery is wanted to finish
the work. You know that it is possible to use a
fancy stitch, such as the Turkish stitch described
in the last chapter, but in that case the material
will have to be turned back and hemmed. The
twill or purl of buttonholing, as the little ridge on
the edge is called, serves as a resistance for the
material from fraying out.</p>

<p>The buttonhole stitch is the most popular in
embroidery. It is the foundation for many other
stitches. Feather-stitching is really an open form
of this stitch.</p>

<p>As a usual thing it is necessary to pad before
working buttonholing. It raises the work and makes
it much more durable as an edge. The padding can
be done in either running-stitch or chain-stitching.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span></p>

<p>Let us take for our first example the straight
buttonholing. It is the simplest form. Cover the
space between the lines with coarse, running stitches.
Let the background be medium weight linen. The
padding thread should be No. 16 or No. 20 marking
cotton, or two strands of white darning cotton makes
an excellent padding. The stitches can be fully
one quarter of an inch in length. Take up a single
thread of the background so that the padding will
be all on the top of the material. This keeps the
work well raised on the right side and perfectly
flat on the wrong side. An extra row or two toward
the outer edge of buttonholing raises the edge prettily.
Chain-stitching is a more rapid way of padding,
but should only be used for coarse work.
Remember that the wider the buttonholing the more
padding will be necessary.</p>

<p>The padding should be worked over your embroidery
hoops, keeping the work as near to your fingers
as possible. The actual buttonholing gets a rounder
effect if done over the finger, though it is possible,
of course, to do it over the hoops.</p>

<p>Again, no knots in buttonholing. Thread your
needle with No. 25 marking cotton. Make three
little running stitches and one back-stitch to insure
firmness in the starting. Let your thread come up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
slightly under the lower line of the buttonholing.
With your left thumb holding the thread down to
the material draw your thread to the right, take a
stitch over the padding, bringing the needle out
slightly below the lower line. The thread should
fall under the point of the needle in each stitch.</p>

<p>The next thing we learn in buttonholing is a
scallop. The deeper the scallop the more difficult
it is to make a good corner and to keep the slant
of the stitches right. When you buy a stamped
piece of embroidery, select a pattern that has a
shallow scallop and one where the points are not too
sharp. In working a scallop the stitches should
slant vertically in the direct centre, slanting the other
stitches toward this point (<a href="#Fig117">Figure 117</a>).</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<a name="Fig117"></a><img src="images/i_150.jpg" width="500" height="294" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 117. A simple scallop</div>
</div>

<p>The object in carrying the needle slightly beyond
the stamped line is that all the stamping may be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
well covered. A stitch that is taken directly through
the line shows the stamping.</p>

<p>The diagrams (Figures <a href="#Fig117">117</a> and <a href="#Fig118">118</a>) show
how to work a simple
scallop and one with
a sharp scallop. A
good deal has been
written about the
cutting of scallops,
but the safest and
wisest is to wash the
piece before cutting
out the scallops. A
pair of small embroidery scissors should be used
to cut the material away close to the twill of the
buttonholing. If a scallop is cut before it is washed
it frays so much that the edge has an untidy look.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 400px;">
<a name="Fig118"></a><img src="images/i_151.jpg" width="400" height="334" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 118. A sharp scallop</div>
</div>

<p>Some women work a row of machine stitching
close to the lower edge before padding it, as a
preventive from fraying, while others insist on
cutting the material to allow a hem on the wrong
side only. Try the first way and see if you are not
successful. Another point to bear in mind in buttonholing
is that the stitches should be taken very
close to each other. If a piece of buttonholing is
well done it is hard to distinguish one stitch from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
the other, and yet they must not be made one on top
of the other or the buttonholing will be rough.</p>

<p>Wallachian work gets its name from a little
community in Pennsylvania.
It is a German word and is
nothing more than coarse
buttonholing. It is especially
appropriate on heavy
waists, centre pieces, pillow
tops or work bags. A finer
form of it looks well on sheer
waists. The rings or circles are worked from a centre
like the spokes in a cart wheel (<a href="#Fig119">Figure 119</a>).</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 300px;">
<a name="Fig119"></a><img src="images/i_152.jpg" width="300" height="300" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 119. A Wallachian ring</div>
</div>

<div class="figright" style="width: 300px;">
<a name="Fig120"></a><img src="images/i_152a.jpg" width="300" height="296" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 120. Wallachian stitch</div>
</div>

<p>The leaves or petals of a Wallachian figure are
worked on the slant, and here is the difference from
ordinary buttonholing and the distinctive feature
of Wallachian embroidery.
Usually the petals have an
indented top and a line
running through the centre.
Begin at the lower
right-hand section and take
a short stitch on the line
as for outlining. The next
stitch is taken close to this
from the midrib to the outer right-hand edge. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
stitches need not be quite as close as in buttonholing
and no padding is required. Continue in the same
slant to where the centre line stops. The stitches
from this point radiate till they are in a good slant
to continue down the left side. Note the stitches
in the diagram (<a href="#Fig120">Figure 120</a>).</p>

<p>Some people do not slant their stitches and the
result is that the work is
not as pretty and loses
its chief charm.</p>

<p>Placing your thimble
on a piece of material,
make a little circle around
it and in the centre make
a little dot to practise the
Wallachian ring on.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 400px;">
<a name="Fig121"></a><img src="images/i_153.jpg" width="400" height="571" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 121. A whisk broom holder in
Wallachian stitch</div>
</div>

<p>You will find that your
thimble or spool is a great
help to you also in making
scallops. Draw a line
with the ruler just below
where you want your scallop to be. Inscribe half a
circle with the aid of your thimble or spool on the
straight line. Just within this half-circle draw another
half-circle that will touch the upper line of the
scallop. A ten-cent piece or in fact any coin can be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
used like this. Embroidered pieces should be washed
by themselves, especially if they are worked in
colours.</p>

<p>A little girl I was teaching some years ago was
very slow in working a centre piece. She finished
the piece one day just before her term was over.
Thinking that she would surprise me, little Daisy
decided to launder the piece herself. Her mother
knew nothing about embroidery, so was not able to
tell her how to proceed. So Daisy washed the piece
and having seen how mother bleached the linens,
Daisy desired to give her piece a sun bath. She
spread it out in the sun and when she went for it
the colour was half out. Poor little Daisy was
heart-broken. She would not have had this trouble
had she observed the following directions:</p>

<p>Put the piece to launder in warm water and rub
it with a pure soap, such as castile. Ordinary
laundry soaps are too strong of lye to be used. If
the piece is very soiled let it soak a long time, several
hours. Usually washing the piece out in water is
sufficient. Rub with the hand only. Rinse in
clean water and lay the piece on a thick cloth or a
Turkish towel. Roll the towel up and leave until
the piece is almost dry.</p>

<p>Lay the embroidery, with the worked side down,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
over a heavy padded surface. Press with a hot iron
quickly. If the centre of the piece puckers, dampen
it again till you have pressed it out thoroughly.</p>

<p>If you fear to put the iron directly on the piece
lay a thin white cloth over it and then press. Many
a really beautiful piece is spoiled in the laundering.</p>

<h2><a name="XIII" id="XIII"></a>XIII<br /><br />
<small>ROMAN CUT-WORK, FANCY BUTTONHOLING FOR
BORDERS, WORK BAGS, BERMUDA FAGOTTING</small></h2>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Roman</span> cut-work or Colbert embroidery is
one of the prettiest forms of buttonholing.
The right way to work it is to make the
stitches so that each one is distinct from the other.
Some people insist on crowding the stitches as in
regular fine buttonholing, which is quite a mistake,
as its distinctness lies in dissimilarity to the ordinary
buttonholing (<a href="#Fig122">Figure 122</a>).</p>

<p>The work is used for centre pieces, corners of
lunch napkins, coat sets, as well as on heavy linen
dresses. In Scotland the little girls make the entire
yokes of their night gowns in cut-work as well as
the top of their night gown case. These cases are
placed on top of the bed pillows during the day and
are marvels of fine handwork. This custom is
not restricted to Scotland, but Italian, French, and
German women are also proud of their night dress
cases.</p>

<p>The design for Roman cut-work should be bold<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
and not too close together. It should be stamped
directly on the material. The American way of
working it is to run a line of fine stitches on the
outline and then work a row of buttonholing. The
stitches are a little less than an eighth of an inch
deep. The background spaces between the design
are then cut away close to the buttonhole edge.
Do not neglect to wet and press the linen before
cutting the buttonholing. Keep the twill of the
buttonholing on the outer edge of the design so that
the background will be bordered with the twilled
edges (<a href="#Fig123">Figure 123</a>).</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<a name="Fig122"></a><img src="images/i_157.jpg" width="400" height="423" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 122. Roman cut-work</div>
</div>

<p>The European method of Roman cut-work is to
run the thread first and then cut the material so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
that there is an eighth of an inch extending beyond
the running stitches. This is turned under till
the running thread forms the edge and then the
buttonholing is worked through both thicknesses
of the material. This way prevents the linen from
fraying. The design is basted over a piece of
coloured paper, letting the basting stitches follow
closely the buttonholing. The wide spaces are then
filled in with a simple lace stitch such as the twisted
bar, woven bar, or spiders. Sometimes the spider is
used in conjunction with one of the former stitches,
and it is an excellent stitch for filling in the corners.
Marking cotton No. 20 or No. 25 should be used for
Roman cut-work, as well as the lace stitches.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<a name="Fig123"></a><img src="images/i_158.jpg" width="500" height="492" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 123. A Roman cut-work centre piece</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span></p>

<p>To make the twisted bar, plan the open spaces
so that they will be well filled and yet not too
crowded. Span from one side of the space to the
other with the thread, then return and whip the
thread or stitch three or four times. The stitches
may be connected and have the appearance of a
series of points (<a href="#Fig124">Figure 124</a>).</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<a name="Fig124"></a><img src="images/i_159.jpg" width="500" height="203" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 124. The twisted bar</div>
</div>

<p>The woven bars are made by working two threads
across the space about one eighth of an inch apart.
Start from one end and weave. Take up one thread
on the upward and the other thread on the downward
pass. Continue in this manner till the whole
bar is woven. The bars are placed at equal distances
apart (<a href="#Fig125">Figure 125</a>).</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span></p>

<p>The spider is a little more complicated. It is
made on an uneven number of threads, usually seven.
They may be double or single. To make the whipped
or double-thread spider, span the space with
the thread and then whip back to the centre and
connect the thread to the buttonholing again at
some little distance from the first stitch. Whip
back to the centre again and take a stitch directly
opposite. Continue in this manner till there are
five, seven, or nine threads around the centre,
then proceed to weave under one and over the next
thread until a good-sized spider is made. Do not
make too large a spider, as it detracts from the
work.   An illustration for the single spider is given
in the chapter on lace
stitches.</p>

<p>The blanket stitch is
a favourite for working
the edge of flannel
skirts or quilted covers.
Worsted or coarse silk
can be used for it. It is made on the raw or folded
edge of the material. Two stitches are long and two
are short. Sometimes they are worked like a pyramid.
Beginning at the base we increase each stitch
till we reach the point and then decrease each stitch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
in length as we work back to the base on the other
side (<a href="#Fig126">Figure 126</a>).</p>

<p>The triangular buttonhole is a pretty stitch for
a conventional design that has long narrow sections.
It may also be used for working a very large
simple scallop (<a href="#Fig127">Figure 127</a>). The way we were
taught in school was
to mark the section
to be worked in deep
points. The twill of
the buttonholing
must come on the
lines. The stitches
are not very close to each other. The stitches are
taken on the line across to the next line. Begin at
the longest opening and make every stitch shorter.
When the line is covered, turn the work so that the
twill of the buttonholing touches the top of the
stitches just made. If this stitch is used on the
outer scallop it will be necessary to hem the material,
letting the triangular buttonholing form the edge.</p>

<div class="caption">Fig. 127. The triangular buttonholing</div>
</div>

<p>Then there are fancy forms of buttonholing that
are used especially in Mount Mellick work. The
double buttonhole stitch is effective to fill in the
large leaves. The stitches are taken in groups of
two, then a little space and two more stitches. Continue<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
in straight rows. Sometimes one will see a
leaf worked one half in double buttonholing and the
other half in a close stitch.</p>

<div class="caption">Fig. 128. The honeycomb stitch</div>
</div>

<p>The honeycomb or mesh is a fancy name for
another form of buttonholing. Work a row of
buttonholing about a quarter of an inch apart.
The distance may be changed to suit the design
you are working on. In the second and all other
rows, the needle is over the buttonhole loop directly
above and a short stitch taken a quarter of an inch,
or the distance you have decided on, below the loop.
In starting each row bring the needle up a quarter
of an inch, or more or less as you desire, below the
previous row. The distance must be kept even
to achieve satisfactory results. It is not necessary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
to start from one side always. The first row is
worked from left to right, the second from right to
left and so on, back and forth, till the space is
filled (<a href="#Fig128">Figure 128</a>).</p>

<p>Bermuda fagotting is the name of a stitch that
gives the effect of drawn work, when no threads
have been drawn. It is used on scroll designs as
well as to outline a simple floral pattern. Lawn,
dimity, China silk, handkerchief linen, or nainsook
are the prettiest materials for this stitch, as it demands
a fine, transparent background to give the
right effect.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 200px;">
<a name="Fig129"></a><img src="images/i_163.jpg" width="200" height="362" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 129. Diagram of
stitches</div>
</div>

<p>Sewing cotton No. 100 or 150
and a special needle are the only
requirements for this work. The
needles can be bought from any
art needlework shop for five cents
each. It is like a large-sized
carpet needle with a small eye.
A carpet needle can be substituted
if it is not possible to
obtain the regular needle in your locality. Tie
one end of the thread to the eye of the needle.
While practising this stitch it will be necessary
to make guide lines. On each side of the design
line make a row of dots an eighth of an inch apart.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
The dots above the line must be directly over the
lower dots. Note the diagram (<a href="#Fig129">Figure 129</a>) of this
stitch. I have numbered the first six dots.</p>

<p>Take a stitch from one to three and tie the end
of the thread under this point. Make the stitch
a second time from these points,
pulling the material between
them closely. Pass the needle
underneath and connect one and
two with two stitches. Then
pass to point four and connect
two. Three and four are connected
in the same manner. It is only necessary to tie
the thread when commencing the work or a new thread.
The needle is so large that it makes quite a hole in the
material and the thread is so fine that the manner of
working is not clear to the average eye unless a detailed
explanation is given (<a href="#Fig130">Figure 130</a>).</p>

<div class="caption">Fig. 130. An enlarged
drawing of Bermuda fagotting </div>
</div>

<p>When working on a curved line or a corner it
will be necessary to make an extra stitch on the outer
or longer side only.</p>

<p>The scroll lines or stems of a conventional shirtwaist
design are more dainty when made in Bermuda
fagotting. The corners of handkerchiefs or a design
on underwear or yokes and collars lend themselves
to this style of adornment.</p>

<h2><a name="XIV" id="XIV"></a>XIV<br /><br />
<small>SATIN-STITCH AND MARKING</small></h2>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">The</span> more interested we become in embroidery
the more we find how much more
there still is to be learned about it.</p>

<p>There may be embroiderers who are experts in
one branch of the subject and yet who will do very
unsatisfactory work in another. For instance, one
girl may be very proficient in fancy stitches and yet
may not do the simple stitches or vice versa. Few
American girls excel in the satin-stitch, not because
it is hard, but it must be perfectly accurate. The
average German, Swiss or French child can do better
satin-stitch at the age of twelve than
the average American woman does.
From the time the children in those
countries can hold a needle in their
hand they are taught to sew and embroider.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 200px;">
<a name="Fig131"></a><img src="images/i_165.jpg" width="200" height="242" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 131. A letter
in satin-stitch </div>
</div>

<p>Satin-stitch is a stitch that is taken
over and over across a space. Sometimes it is quite
heavily padded and at a first glance gives the appearance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
of a piece of material heavily raised.
Fine designs should, however, be slightly padded.
There are three ways in which padding may be
done. There is the running or uneven
darning, the chain, or the
filling-stitch. A great deal depends
on the smoothness of the
padding. The chain-stitch should
only be used for coarse work. The
padding should not cover the
stamped outlines, for they are
needed as a guide for the satin-stitch.
The padding is usually worked in a heavier
thread than the outer stitches. Darning cotton
that comes in four strands is often used. One or
two strands is sufficient.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 250px;">
<a name="Fig131A"></a><img src="images/i_166.jpg" width="250" height="369" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 131A. Satin-stitch</div>
</div>

<p>The prettiest satin-stitch is taken straight
across. The stitches should not be crowded,
but should be worked so that when the
embroidery is finished the stitches are hard
to distinguish one from the other.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 150px;">
<a name="Fig131B"></a><img src="images/i_166a.jpg" width="150" height="140" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 131B.
Satin-stitch

</div>

<p>The Old English letter "E" (<a href="#Fig131">Figure 131</a>) shows
a good example of satin-stitch and outlining. The
latter was used on the single lines. The entire
letter may be carried out in satin-stitch by first
running the single lines with uneven darning stitches<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
and then covering these with fine satin-stitches.
Make the padding stitches as close together as possible,
or the satin-stitches will be uneven.</p>

<p>The letter "C" (<a href="#Fig132">Figure 132</a>) offers an opportunity
of combining two
colours. After the satin-stitch
has been done, a little back-stitch
is worked through the
centre of the heavily padded
sections. This combination of
stitches is pleasing when colour
is used, as the satin-stitch is in
one colour and the centre stitches in
another. A great many of the regular
sewing stitches can be used instead
of the embroidery ones. For
the very fine lines, back-stitching
can be used, making the stitches
finer than those used in ordinary
sewing.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 250px;">

<div class="caption">Fig. 132. Satin-stitching
and seeding </div>
</div>

<p>The letter "A" of <a href="#Fig133">Figure 133</a> shows a good combination
of satin-stitch and back-stitching.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 200px;">
<a name="Fig133"></a><img src="images/i_167a.jpg" width="200" height="242" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 133. Satin-stitch
and back-stitching </div>
</div>

<p>Satin-stitch can be worked straight across or on
the slant. Most of the modern work is straight,
though a great many Germans still prefer to slant
their stitches. The work should be held toward<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
you and the needle straight. The padding should
be worked lengthwise on the design and the satin-stitch
in the opposite direction.</p>

<p>The Chinese do beautiful embroidery, usually
in satin-stitch which is not padded and the finest
of silks are employed for the work.</p>

<p>Another way of marking is to make a row of
French knots along the outline design. A single
line script letter lends itself best to
this kind of work.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 200px;">
<a name="Fig134"></a><img src="images/i_168.jpg" width="200" height="221" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 134. A simple letter
in back-stitching </div>
</div>

<p>For bath towels an outlined letter
is better than a padded one.
The letter on a school bag or a
heavy Turkish towel should be
very simple as the wear they get
does not warrant the spending of
too much time on them. If there is a monogram
to be made it is prettier if the initials of the Christian
name be light and the surname heavy.</p>

<p>We learned about outlining in the first chapter
of embroidery stitches, but outlining in combination
with outer stitches is a little surprise for you.
We have the German to thank for most of the good
combinations of stitches or letters. After the letter
has been outlined in white, we will say, a thread of
colour is taken. Starting from the upper left-hand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
side the needle is passed under the first stitch of
the outlining, up through the second stitch and down
again through the third,
till every stitch has
been taken up on the
needle (<a href="#Fig135">Figure 135</a>).
The   threaded   needle
should not pass through the material
except at the beginning and end of each
line (<a href="#Fig136">Figure 136</a>).</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 400px;">

<div class="caption">Fig. 136. A

</div>

<p>Another manner in which a letter may
be embroidered, especially an old English
letter, is to work it solid in white
and outline it in colour. The Van
Dyke point is good also where a
broad space is to be filled. It is
sometimes called the bird's-eye
stitch.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 200px;">
<a name="Fig137"></a><img src="images/i_169b.jpg" width="200" height="101" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 137. A simple
way to work a letter </div>
</div>

<p>Start at the top and on the left
side of the letter or space it is to
fill. Insert the needle on the right side and take a
stitch to the centre on a slant like a buttonhole
stitch. Fasten to the material with a little short
stitch. Bring needle out at the extreme left and
repeat directions until the space is filled. Each
stitch forms a V (note <a href="#Fig138">Figure 138</a>).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span></p>

<p>Sometimes you will find a very elaborate letter,
the outline of which has been worked in satin-stitch
or French stemming. Little eyelets or satin-stitch
dots are worked
between the lines.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 450px;">
<a name="Fig138"></a><img src="images/i_170.jpg" width="450" height="855" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 138. Van Dyke stitch</div>
</div>

<p>When two or more
letters intertwine they
are called a monogram.
It is not every
set of letters that
will make good monograms.
Letters that
have a good swing
should be selected so
that though they intertwine
each letter
should stand forth
clearly. It is permissible
to use the surname
initial a trifle
larger than the Christian
initial. When
monograms are composed
of three letters and one of the smaller letters
is placed on either side of the larger one the effect
is very pleasing. The smaller the letters, the finer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
the thread should be. No. 50 or 60 marking cotton
can be used for letters one half-inch in size. A
three-quarter inch letter should be
carried out in No. 45 marking cotton.
A one-inch letter requires No.
35 cotton, while the two-inch letters
take No. 30 and so on. The larger
the letter the coarser the cotton.</p>

<div class="caption">Fig. 139A. Seeding </div>
</div>

<p>The beauty of a monogram is to
have something original. Perhaps
you want to work your bag. Take a tea cup
and place on the material in the position you desire
the monogram. Run a faint pencil line
around the cup. Draw a block letter in the centre
so that it touches the upper and lower edges of
the circle. Your two Christian
initials are then placed
one on each side of the
centre letter. Try to fit the
letters so as to keep the circle
perfect. It may be you
will not really draw block
letters, but so much the better,
as the monogram will be more original. If it
is impossible to make a complete circle with the
letters, embroider the sections of the circle between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
the letters in stem-stitch. Stem-stitch, you will
remember, is an outline-stitch covered with the over-and-over
or small satin-stitch.</p>

<p>A monogram of this sort is especially appropriate
for a man's handkerchief. A twenty-five-cent piece,
or a fifty-cent piece if it is a very large handkerchief,
should be used for the circle. Seeding (<a href="#Fig139A">Figure
139A</a>) may be combined with satin-stitch in working
monograms. Seeding is nothing more than a series of
little back-stitches. A good effect is obtained by
working one letter in satin-stitch and the other in
seeding. It will be necessary to outline the outer
edges of the seeded letter.</p>

<p>You have probably noticed the gold emblems and
lettering on the sleeves of army officers' regimentals.
They are generally worked in bullion, though sometimes
gold thread is used. Bullion comes in gold and
silver and at the first glance looks like the Oriental
gold or silver threads. The difference is, however,
that bullion is tubular, while the threads are usually
composed of two or three strands twisted together
or over and over a thread of red cotton. The red
cotton makes a strong foundation for the gold threads
and, by the way, do you know that all silk that comes
on spools has a fine thread of cotton running through
the centre? The purer the silk the less cotton is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
used, but the latter is very necessary, as the threads
will not stand very much strain if they are all
silk.</p>

<p>Now let us get back to emblems in bullion. It is
necessary in bullion work to have a fine cardboard
foundation which is called "the cartoon." Trace
your design on the cardboard and then cut the design
out. Baste the cartoon to the background, which
may be of any material you desire. Broadcloths,
silks, satins, and velvets are the materials usually
selected for the work. Thread a fine needle with a
piece of silk. Fasten the thread on the wrong side
of the material and bring the needle up through the
right side. Let us suppose that you are working the
block letter A. Start from the apex of the letter.
Cut a piece of the bullion just the size of a very small
bead. Slip the needle through the cut piece of
bullion and span the point of the letter. Continue
in this manner till the cardboard is closely covered
with the bullion. Each piece of bullion is cut to
fit the space it is to cover.</p>

<p>In working a five pointed star, start and pad each
section lengthwise, if it is to be embroidered in silk
or cotton. For bullion work the cartoon is always
necessary.</p>

<p>Work each section of the star from the point to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
the centre. Work from left to right, so that each
section that is worked is to the left.</p>

<p>Papier-mach&eacute; letters can be bought that may be
used as a padding. They are very satisfactory for
anything that is not to be laundered, but continual
washings flatten the papier-mach&eacute;, while if the padding
is made of cotton it lasts as long as the
background.</p>

<p>Handkerchiefs for yourself can be daintily marked
in very fine feather-stitching in D. M. C. marking
cotton No. 80. Remember to keep the stitches
in a pretty slant.</p>

<p>There are numerous places that a letter or monogram
can be used. A girl I know who is at a boarding
school has marked all her bed linen and towels.
For each pair of sheets and two pillow cases she
uses a different style letter or monogram so that her
linen is in sets.</p>

<p>Cross-stitching is appropriate for bath towels,
although face towels are often very attractive worked
in this stitch.</p>

<p>The question often arises as to which is the
right place to put a letter or monogram on a
table cloth, napkin, pillow case, or sheet, and
though you may not be interested in any of
these articles at present, it is well to know these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
little points when helping to mark the household
linens.</p>

<p>Napkins are usually marked with the letter in
the direct centre when folded. Of course, like
many other things, there are fads for changing
the position. One extreme style is to mark the
letter in the direct centre of the napkin. This
style necessitates folding the napkin in a fancy shape
so that the embroidery will be seen at its best advantage.</p>

<p>There are two good ways to mark a table cloth.
One is to place the lettering midway between one
corner of the table and the hem. When the cloth
is on the table the letter is below the top. The
second and newer way is to have the letter on the
top of the table on a line with the plates. If two
sets of letters or monograms are used place them at
diagonal corners.</p>

<p>On sheets the letters should be placed two and a
half inches above the hem. The letter is worked so
that when the sheet is folded back the base of the
letter is toward the foot of the bed.</p>

<p>Pillow cases or towels are marked in the centre of
one side, two inches above the hem.</p>

<p>Again let me impress upon you not to embroider
white washable material in silk, thinking that because<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
silks are more expensive they are better.
Silks are apt to discolour in laundering. Cottons
are now manufactured that have a high gloss like
silk and yet they never discolour.</p>

<div class="caption">Fig. 141. A simple

</div>

<p>Another pretty and new way to mark letters
on lawn or fine linen handkerchiefs is one that gives
the effect of Bermuda fagotting and yet it is only
hemming with a large needle (<a href="#Fig140">Figure 140</a>). Draw
the letter in pencil on the handkerchief. Thread
a large tapestry or chenille needle with a piece of
No. 200 linen thread. Cotton thread may be used
but it is very apt to break. Tie one end of the thread<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
to the eye of the needle so that it does not slip out.
Thread another needle with a strand of No. 8
marking cotton and pass it to the back at the beginning
of the letter. Unthread the needle, allowing
a half inch to extend out of the back. Let the No. 8
cotton follow the lines of the letter and
take a stitch into the material with
the large needle. Work from right
to left, holding the No. 8 cotton
from you. Pull the fine thread tight
around the stitch you have taken.
Now pass your needle around the
same group of threads of the material, holding
the stitch over the heavy cotton. Work around the
entire outside of the letter, then turn and work the inner
line. Stitch again through the hole already made,
taking up the same group of threads. Sometimes
this style is called ladder-stitch, as the heavy cotton
gives the effect of the side of the ladder and the
groups of threads represent the rungs. Any design
that is uniformly narrow can be carried out in
ladder-stitch.</p>

<h2><a name="XV" id="XV"></a>XV<br /><br />
<small>EYELETS AND FRENCH KNOTS, BULLION STITCH, AND
OTHER FANCY STITCHES.</small></h2>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">The</span> most beautiful of the embroidery stitches
is the eyelet, and it is also one of the hardest.
A piece of embroidery that is thickly
covered with eyelet-work and possibly a little satin-stitch
and buttonholing is commonly termed
Madeira embroidery. One will often see a piece
of the Madeira embroidery so closely covered that
it is almost impossible to put another stitch in
between the embroidered spots. About fifty years
ago it was a matter of impossibility to buy machine
embroidery, and eyelet-work was one of the last
things made by machine. It was an easy matter
to distinguish the hand-work from the machine-work
up to about five years ago. A certain regularity
of the stitches and the kind of thread used proclaimed
it machine to even the amateur. Now-a-days
the crafty manufacturers stamp the material
to imitate the hand-made embroideries and use a
thread of the same quality so that sometimes the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
professional embroiderers find it hard to distinguish
it from the real.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 500px;">
<a name="Fig142"></a><img src="images/i_179.jpg" width="500" height="441" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 142. Baby's bootees</div>
</div>

<p>If you should ask a boy who has watched his
mother working one, what an eyelet is he will probably
tell you that it is cutting holes in the material
and sewing them up again. To his mind this is a
great waste of time.</p>

<p>Besides being ornamental,
the eyelets
often play an
important part.
They are used to
run ribbon through
in corset covers,
night-gowns and
other pieces of underwear,
as well as
on bags, baby bootees, (<a href="#Fig142">Figure 142</a>), caps and carriage
covers. No machine beading can impart the
elegance that a well-made eyelet does to a personal
garment. Eyelets can be either round or oval. For
a small round one run a tracing thread on the outline.
Let each stitch take up but one or two threads of
the material. Use No. 35 or finer marking cotton
for small eyelets. With your stiletto pierce a hole
in the outlined edge till it is just the size of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
stamped eyelet. Now with the same thread sew
around the opening with close over-and-over stitches.
The stitches should only be the width of the stamped
line (<a href="#Fig143">Figure 143</a>). They must be even, else you
will have a "Pig's-eye."</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 200px;">

<div class="caption">Fig. 143. The way to
work an eyelet </div>
</div>

<p>For the large round eyelet, as
well as the oval, in all sizes it will
be necessary to cut the material
within the outline which has first
been traced with the running
thread. The cuts should be made
lengthwise and crosswise, right to
the tracing thread. The cut material
is turned under to the wrong
side and the eyelet worked as just described.
After the embroidery is finished
turn the material over and any part of
the cut cloth that extends beyond the
stitches trim off. Your fine embroidery
scissors should be used for the cutting.</p>

<p>Sometimes you might like to make an eyelet to
represent a grape. Some embroiderers call it a
shaded or padded eyelet. After the eyelet has
been traced make another row of tracing or padding
below the lower half of the eyelet. Start from the
centre side of the eyelet and make the second<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
tracing deeper on the lower portion of the eyelet.
If any space is left between these two rows of
tracings fill in with other rows of uneven
darning (<a href="#Fig144A">Figure 144A</a>).</p>

<p>When eyelets are used on the outer
edge of a design, they should be buttonholed.</p>

</div>

<p>The next stitch to claim our attention
is French knots. In France they are
known as the English knot. They are used to fill in
the centres of flowers. When working a piece of
golden rod the natural effect is best produced by
using French knots very close to each other. A<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
row worked on each side of a row of feather
stitching makes a pretty decoration on babies'
dresses, caps or even on yokes of dresses for yourself.</p>

<div class="caption">Fig. 146. An eyelet design for a pillow</div>
</div>

<p>A heavy thread is good to practise making the
knot. The actual size or kind of thread to use
should depend partly on the kind of material and
partly upon the other style of work or stitches that
you intend combining with it.</p>

<div class="caption">Many a Happy Hour is Spent Embroidering</div>
</div>

<p>To work the knot, fasten the thread securely on
the wrong side and bring the needle through to
the right side. Now hold the thread down with
your left thumb. With the right hand put the
needle over and under the thread until there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
are three or four coils of the thread around the
point of the needle. Now hold these coils down
with the left thumb. Turn the needle so that its
point will go down through the material as close as
possible to the place through which it came
(<a href="#Fig147">Figure 147</a>).</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 250px;">
<a name="Fig147"></a><img src="images/i_185.jpg" width="250" height="379" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 147. French knots</div>
</div>

<p>A pretty idea for making knots for dress trimmings
is to thread the needle with two
strands of silk, each of a different
colour.</p>

<p>Bullion stitch is an elongated
French knot. It is used considerably
in Mountmellick embroidery,
to represent grains of wheat. Small
leaves and daisies are oftentimes
carried out in bullion stitch.</p>

<p>To make the stitch we will say that we are working
on the conventional daisy. Bring the thread
up to the base of the petal. Insert the needle so
that the length of the petal lies on top of it. (See
<a href="#Fig148">Figure 148</a>.) Twine the thread around the
needle point until there are as many coils as the
length of the petal. The left thumb should hold
the coils in place while you are twisting them. The
needle is now drawn through the material. It is
put through the same hole, or as near as possible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
to the one from which it came. Keep the left
thumb holding down the coils until the stitch has
been fastened.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 300px;">
<a name="Fig148"></a><img src="images/i_186.jpg" width="300" height="390" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 148. Bullion-stitch</div>
</div>

<p>Another way to accomplish
bullion stitch, which has the
same appearance, but which
really is a very much slower
method, is to lay a heavy thread
the length of the stitch desired
and then neatly wind the cotton
over it. It requires a heavy
cotton to work this successfully.</p>

<p>An embroidery needle should not be used for
either French knots or bullion stitch, as the eye
is apt to stick when pulling it through the
coils. A large sewing needle should be substituted.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<a name="Fig149"></a><img src="images/i_186a.jpg" width="600" height="229" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 149. An elaborate piece of buttonholing and satin-stitch</div>
</div>

<p>Any girl can make dainty and original designs for
eyelet work if she will invest in compasses. As<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
has been stated before, eyelets vary in size. The size
that is most effective for decorating heavy linen
or cotton is an eyelet a little less than half an inch
in diameter. A larger eyelet is often used, but it
requires a good deal of patience and experience to
keep it in shape.</p>

<p>With the compass hundreds of designs may be
used. The most popular as well as being the most
attractive is the simple daisy. A circle is drawn to
represent the centre. A quarter of an inch over
from the centre circle, or less if you wish to, draw
six other circles so that they form a ring around
the centre dot.</p>

<p>A design such as this can be used on a ruffle of a
petticoat or between tucks on dresses while for a
whole linen piece there is nothing handsomer for
a scalloped or hemstitched centre piece, doily, bureau
cover and many other articles on which a bold, open
effect is appropriate.</p>

<p>The Wall-of-Troy design is a good one for compass
work, only it is suggested to faintly rule the
design then inscribe the circles so that their centres
are on the line. For instance, suppose you want to
make a border design about an inch and a half deep.
Take your rule and keeping on a straight thread of
your material draw a two-inch line, then leave a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
space, then draw another line, so on to the end. An
inch and a half above these lines draw another row of
lines just over the spaces of the first row. Connect
the ends of the lines together. Plan so that there is a
circle at the points or corners of each line. Between
these dots on the horizontal lines make two more
circles, while on the vertical lines make only one.
These instructions are for a circle the size described;
for a smaller eyelet it will be necessary to add
more circles to the lines.</p>

<p>A still simpler design is one that is made on a
square, that is, with a dot at each corner and one in
the direct centre. The dots must be kept the same
distance apart.</p>

<p>The Italian girls will make the most elaborate
designs of compass work on strips of firm, heavy
muslin for ruffles for underwear. They are not
like the American and French girls, who will only
wear the sheerest kind of light material. The advantage
the Italian girl has over her French and
American sisters is that when she embroiders a
garment it lasts for years, even if it is constantly
used, while delicate embroidery is apt to have a
very short life on account of the background. To
the American girl this is no drawback, as she is
always craving for new things.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span></p>

<p>Sometimes a thimble, spool, or even a twenty-five
cent piece is used instead of the compass when a
large eyelet is required.</p>

<p>An edge of eyelets is very handsome on a collar
and cuff set or handkerchief. They should be placed
so that after they are worked they touch each other.
The entire eyelet may be carried out in buttonholing
or the lower half may be buttonholed and
the top worked in the regular way. After the work
has been completed dampen the edge and press
before cutting out the material from underneath
the lower edge of the eyelet.</p>

<p>It is possible to work the eyelet without any
buttonhole stitches and yet use it for an edge. In
that case a little padding is required and the stitches
should be close together.</p>

<p>A linen hat that has a simple scallop edge and a
simple design on the brim and crown is a treasure
that usually only the wealthy enjoy. It is nice
to know how to embroider, but unless we put to use
the things we know our knowledge is like a white
elephant on our hands. After a careful study of
the diagram of the stitches you desire to make and
reading the description as to how to make it, a
little child could almost work a hat, but the mounting
of a hat is not so simple. Yet, what is the use of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
taking time to embroider one if you do not intend
to make it up?</p>

<p>Eyelet work is particularly dainty on a hat as
it gives a lacy effect.
The material should be
a medium weight linen
so as not to be too stiff.
At one time butcher's
linen was thought to
be the only kind to
be used, but of later years a softer linen is preferred.
Lingerie hats have been used for years,
probably long before you were born. Every year
the shape varies a little. One year it is a narrow
brim sailor, next year it is a wide brim, then again
a high, next a Tam-o'-shanter crown. The last
four years it has been the mushroom shape. For
most faces there is nothing more becoming and
girlish than the latter (<a href="#Fig150">Figure 150</a>).</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 400px;">
<a name="Fig150"></a><img src="images/i_190.jpg" width="400" height="250" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 150. A lingerie hat </div>
</div>

<p>Sometimes the mushroom shape is covered with
hand-embroidered ruffles, while again a circular
piece having the crown cut out is used. The size
of hat varies by what fashion dictates, so it is hard
to say just how large your linen should be cut. A
twenty-two or twenty-four inch circle makes a neat
little shape.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span></p>

<p>After the embroidery has been worked as described
in the first part of this chapter, the frame is prepared
for mounting it. A wire frame is lighter and more
satisfactory than a buckram frame.</p>

<p>The first thing to decide is, how are we going to
face the hat? Tucked ruffling, net, dotted swiss,
or fine ruffles of Valenciennes lace may be used.
Most people prefer to cover the entire frame with
cheap, fine lawn before facing or covering the hat.</p>

<p>This is done by placing the hat on the lawn, the
brim touching the material, and cutting a circle a
trifle larger than the brim. Cut a circle out for the
crown and slip the lawn over the frame. If the
crown is too large to allow the lawn to be slipped
over it a wide bias band of the lawn can be used to
cover the brim. The bias strip should be just the
depth of the brim. For the crown, cut a circle large
enough to cover the top and use a bias band around
its sides.</p>

<p>Tack the muslin to the frame by long basting
stitches. It will be necessary to pass under the wire
when taking a stitch to keep the material in place.
The tucked ruffling can be bought by the yard,
trimmed with a row of narrow lace. The entire
thing is banded. To adjust a ruffling of this sort
place the band around the edge of the crown and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
tack the ruffle in position at short intervals and at
the extreme edge of the brim.</p>

<p>Net or dotted Swiss is pretty shirred or corded
or even put on plain. A strip three times the
length that it would take to go around the brim
plain is cut the depth of the brim. This band is
cut on the straight of the goods. A shirring string
is run on both sides. The strip is placed in
position and pinned taking care to distribute the
gathers evenly. The shirring string under the crown
is pulled up first and the material over-handed to
the frame. The gathering thread on the outer edge
of the brim is also adjusted like this, only instead of
over-hand stitches, fine running stitches are preferable.
Then a small heading is made on one side
of the strip that is to be shirred. The heading
makes a pretty, soft finish at the edge and does not
require any great length of time to do. Allow
three quarters of an inch, or more, in the depth of
your ruffle if it is to have a heading. Turn one
edge of the material to the wrong side. The turn
should be a little more than a quarter of an inch
deep. The gathering thread is run a quarter of
an inch from the folded edge of the material. When
the thread is pulled up the heading is formed.</p>

<p>If the material is to be corded, baste a narrow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
round cord like a corset lace inside the material.
The cord is placed where it is desired and the material
is folded over it as for a tuck. A running thread
is worked close to the cord to keep the two pieces
of material together. The threads are afterwards
drawn up to bring the fulness of the ruffles to fit
the outer edge of the hat.</p>

<p>Three rows of cording are quite sufficient on the
edge and the other two rows at equal intervals
from the outer brim to the crown.</p>

<p>The ruffles of Valenciennes lace are adjusted by
pulling the drawing string on the edge of the lace,
and basting the first row of lace on the extreme edge.
The second row just touches the first, and so on,
filling as many rows of lace in as required.</p>

<p>The embroidered piece is then washed and the brim
placed. The edge is tacked at intervals while around
the crown the stitches are taken very close together.</p>

<p>The Tam-o'-shanter crown is pulled in shape by
a gathering thread, if it is cut in a circular shape and
the gathering is all on the edge. Cut the circle large
enough to make a pretty Tam-o'-shanter.</p>

<p>The embroidery decoration may be in the direct
centre of the crown. If the design is a small one
it can be scattered over the crown to give an all
over effect.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span></p>

<p>There are many ways that a lingerie hat may be
trimmed and it is hard to say which is the prettiest.
A black ribbon band and a bow is simple but severe.
White taffeta ribbon may be used the same way if
an all white hat is wanted. In fact any shade
of ribbon is attractive used like this. The illustration
shows a pretty way of trimming a lingerie hat
for a girl of about fourteen. A narrow coloured
ribbon is used around the crown and a rosette of
leaves with rose buds and forget-me-nots is attractively
placed on one side.</p>

<p>Sometimes coloured linen is used for the hat and
in that case the embroidery may be worked in the
same shade as the linen; or white. The hat is then
trimmed with white or black. A coloured hat is not
as practicable as a white one, as the former is apt
to fade and may not be as becoming as the white.</p>

<p>A baby's buttoned hat is made of two circular
pieces scalloped out at the edges, one piece being
four or five inches smaller than the other. The
large one is used for the brim. The head size is
cut out of the direct centre and then bound in tape.
Three inches from the crown opening sew a circular
row of buttons, a half inch apart. Use a washable
linen, lace, or crochet button for this purpose.</p>

<p>One inch from the edge of the crown make as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
many buttonholes as you have buttons. A pair
of daintily hemstitched strings that are attached,
one on each side of the crown opening, completes
this charming little hat. It can be easily unbuttoned
and laundered flat. These hats are made of duck,
pique or heavy linen. They are the nicest thing
you can make for your little sister for the summer
when she wants to play in the sun.</p>

<h2><a name="XVI" id="XVI"></a>XVI<br /><br />
<small>LONG AND SHORT, KENSINGTON EMBROIDERY, AND RIBBON
WORK FOR SIMPLE FLOWERS</small></h2>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">It is</span> the ambition of every one who starts to
embroider to make a piece of flower work and
though the floral designs are most fascinating
to embroider they are by no means as artistic as
the conventional.</p>

<p>The way to embroider a piece of flower work and
obtain an original colouring is to get a natural
flower and place it in a vase in a position that you
can clearly see the light and shadow. The best
flower to start with is a daisy. Note that the
petals are not a dead white, but there is a suggestion
of green toward the centre of the flower. Get
mercerized cotton to work with at first until you
become accustomed to the stitch.</p>

<p>There is no cut and dried rule in regard to the
colouring, but the art of shading a piece naturally is
a lesson that is very essential for the embroiderer.</p>

<p>To many people the term embroidery means flower
work and only after a course of instruction they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
discover for themselves how much more artistic
and in keeping with most rooms is a conventional
design.</p>

<p>Flower work, however, is not to be despised as
you will learn more about colour combination and
Kensington stitch in one piece of this style than any
kind of embroidery.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<a name="Fig151"></a><img src="images/i_197.jpg" width="600" height="485" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 151. Long and short stitch </div>
</div>

<p>All flower work has long and short stitch on the
edge of the petals or leaves that do not turn over.
Daisies do not have turn over leaves as often as a
double rose or chrysanthemum. Suppose we draw
a very large daisy on a piece of white muslin. With
your needle threaded with white lustre start from
the right-hand side. Take one stitch on the line.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
Place your needle back near the same point from
which you started. Take a short stitch that goes
a wee bit outside of the stamped line past the first
stitch. The object of going beyond the line, is that
the stitch completely covers the stamping.</p>

<p>The third stitch is taken at the same slant, only
longer. The fourth is a short one and so on, first
one short and then one long until the top of the petal
is reached. Remember, though, these stitches are
only on the edge. The left half is worked the same,
but the stitches slant a little differently. A good
rule to mention right here is, that all stitches should
slant to the heart of the flower. In leaves they slant
toward the base. The inside of the petal, when the
long and short stitches are completed, should be
irregular (<a href="#Fig151">Figure 151</a>).</p>

<p>The Kensington stitch gets its name from an
English school of embroidery. It is more like outlining
than any other stitch.</p>

<p>After the edge of the flower has been worked in
long and short stitch, the Kensington stitch is used
to give the solid effect.</p>

<p>The piece must be held all the while in a tight
fitting pair of hoops so that it can not sag in the
least.</p>

<p>If the petal is long, two or three rows of Kensington<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
stitch will have to be worked to fill it in. If
silk is desired, two strands are used for the edge
and one strand for the
Kensington stitch. The
stitches are dovetailed into
each other. Each row
must have an irregular
lower edge, else they will
look like bricks laid one
on top of the other. The
stitches should be so
worked that it is difficult
to tell where one ends and the other begins
(<a href="#Fig152">Figure 152</a>).</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 300px;">
<a name="Fig152"></a><img src="images/i_199.jpg" width="300" height="310" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 152. The Kensington stitch </div>
</div>

<p>Three shades of green are sufficient for the leaves
until you are quite expert. In working them embroider
on the edge of the lower half of each leaf
with the second shade and the upper part with the
lightest. Work one side first using the second shade
under the lightest and the third under the second.
Work to the midrib only. It is not necessary to
work in the veins, but if they are desired they
are put in after the leaf has been worked. Do not
hesitate to cover the stamped veining on the leaf
you are working, as the next leaf will be a guide to
where to place the veins. They may be in the lightest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
or deepest shade of green, while sometimes a
reddish-brown is substituted.</p>

<p>The centre of the daisy may be satin-stitch or a
cluster of French knots. If the dot is worked from
the centre to left and from the centre to right you
are more apt to get a perfect outline than when
starting from one side and working to the other.</p>

<p>As a usual thing the lightest shade is on the outer
edge of most flowers, but there are a few exceptions,
like wild roses and some species of pansies in which
the deepest shade is on the edge and toward the
centre it is lightest.</p>

<p>The stems may be worked in satin-stitch or
Kensington in wood shades or deep greens, whichever
give the more realistic effect to the flower.</p>

<p>It is a great mistake to use white for the background
of flower work. Cream or pale gray make
a very much softer and more pleasing effect.</p>

<p>Sometimes a little of the stem brown can be
worked into the leaves.</p>

<p>Have you ever seen a lace spread or centre piece
with flowers embroidered on it? You might think
that the worker was more than ordinarily clever, but
really any one who can embroider flowers can do
this. Baste a piece of fine lawn on the section you
desire to embroider and stamp it with a spray.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
Embroider in the usual way and when the spray
is finished neatly cut away any of the lawn that
extends beyond the flower without cutting the lace.
The result is that the piece has the effect of a natural
flower resting upon it.</p>

<p>The finer the silk used the more delicate shading
can be accomplished.</p>

<p>There is another way to represent flowers that is
particularly beautiful. It is known as ribbon work
or rococo embroidery. The ribbons especially
made for this work vary from slightly less than
one quarter of an inch to a little more than a
half inch in width. The colours do not range in
such long lines as the silks. In fact it is rare to
find a shop that carries more than ten colours.
Sometimes the ribbons are shaded. They are soft
and do not crease quite as readily as an ordinary
ribbon.</p>

<p>A No. 6 crewel needle is about the right size for the
narrow ribbon, while the half inch ribbons need a No. 3.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 250px;">
<a name="Fig153"></a><img src="images/i_201.jpg" width="250" height="138" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 153. Ribbon flowers </div>
</div>

<p>Forget-me-nots, conventionalized
small asters, and little roses
are suitable for the narrow ribbons.
Satin, moire, broadcloth,
or heavy silk are used for the
background and the daintiest of needle cases, jewel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
cases, handkerchief bags, belts, and other little
accessories may be evolved from a small piece
of silk and a few yards of ribbon. The design is
stamped on the background and all the single lines
or stems outlined with filo silk. Let us imagine
we are working on a spray of forget-me-nots.   The
needle is threaded with six inches of the narrow
green ribbon.   Slip your needle from the under side
of the material drawing all the ribbon through but
a quarter of an inch.   One stitch is generally
sufficient for a leaf, though sometimes the leaves
are wider and require two or possibly three stitches.
The ribbon serves the same purpose as silk.   The
one point to remember is that the ribbon should
not be twisted.   Naturally in pulling it through the
material several times it becomes so wrinkled that
a short piece works to better advantage than a
long one.   The flower is made in the same way, one
stitch for each petal and when completed a French
knot is made in the centre of the flower (<a href="#Fig153">Figure 153</a>).</p>

<p>The ends caused from starting and finishing off
are fastened or caught down with a piece of
fine thread on the wrong side.</p>

<p>Do not pull your stitches. The work is very
much prettier when it lies soft and full on the
background.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span></p>

<p>It is well to make use of every piece of fancy work
you do and yet sometimes a new thing may strike
your fancy and you would like to make a small
piece.</p>

<p>A card case is acceptable to every girl and it is
a good plan to make them to match your visiting
dresses.</p>

<p>Take a piece of material five by ten inches long.
Three inches from one of the short edges stamp a
design that will not occupy a space larger than three
inches long and two inches deep. The length of
the design must run parallel with the short edge of
the material. The bottom of the stamping must be
five and a half inches from the short edge of the
material.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<a name="Fig154"></a><img src="images/i_203.jpg" width="400" height="148" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 154. A card case</div>
</div>

<p>A little spray of lilies of the valley on a green silk
background makes a dainty case (<a href="#Fig154">Figure 154</a>).</p>

<p>Get a piece of stiff tailor's canvas and cut it to
measure eight and three quarters inches by four
inches wide. A piece of china silk the same size
as the satin will be needed for the lining.   It is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
best to select the shade of silk that harmonizes with
the outside material. With a green cover a lining
lighter or darker is suggested. The latter is preferred
as the constant fingering of a light colour is apt to
soil it.</p>

<p>Cut all three pieces so that they are true oblongs;
two and a quarter inches from the short edge make
a crease. Two and a half inches from the first crease
or four and three quarters inches from the outer edge
make another crease and cut along it, thus separating
the stiffening in two.</p>

</div>

<p>Two and a half inches on both sides of the now
short edges of the piece that is not creased draw a
line from side to side and crease.</p>

<p>On the extreme right-hand side measure down
one and a half inches from the corner and make a dot;
measure up from the lower corner and make another
dot. The space between the dots should measure
one inch. Take a twenty-five cent piece and place<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
on the space between the dots so that the edge of
the material is under the direct centre of the quarter.
Make a semicircular curve on the canvas around the
quarter. Cut along the pencil lines (<a href="#Fig155">Figure 155</a>).</p>

<div class="caption">Fig. 156. The canvas interlining </div>
</div>

<p>The stiffening now ready, baste it to the lining.
See that all creases have been smoothed out of the
China silk lining before basting. Place the two
pieces of canvas so that there is an equal margin on
all four sides. The cut edges of the canvas must be
placed one eighth of an inch apart as shown in the
diagram (<a href="#Fig156">Figure 156</a>). On one side is the
four and three-quarter inch piece and the other is
the four inch. Pin or baste the canvas through
the centre to keep it in position. With a threaded
needle cat-stitch the silk to the canvas, care being
taken to see that the stitches do not appear on the
silk side. Cat or catch-stitching is another name
for herring-boning, which is explained in the chapter
on feather-stitching.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span></p>

<p>Before turning a corner, cut off a small piece of
material to prevent the corner from being bulky.
Treat each corner in like manner: when you come
to the little curved part, slash the material so that
when it is folded over the canvas
it will fit perfectly smooth.</p>

</div>

<p>Fold the canvas and lining
along the creases originally made
in the canvas. An iron pressed
over them will help to make
them stay in position.
The embroidered piece
is then placed over the
wrong side of the canvas.
A half-inch turn is made on all sides. Turn this half
inch toward the wrong side of the canvas. Sometimes
a layer of cotton batting is laid under the embroidery
between the canvas and satin. The satin piece is
basted to the canvas. The folded edge of the satin
and the folded edge of the silk are overcast with tiny
stitches. Fold back the two sections of the case and
over-cast each side (<a href="#Fig157">Figure 157</a>). Your card case
is now completed.</p>

<p>A bill folder is made in the same way, only that
the ends are not stitched together to form pockets
as in the card case.</p>

<p>It is always well to know how to make pretty,

gifts for Christmas or a birthday.</p>

<p>Nearly everybody has a hobby. Sometimes it is
saving receipts, sometimes keeping newspaper clippings,
and then again it may be keeping theatre
programmes. It is well to consider what gift is
most suitable for the one that is to receive it; to
make for the faddist an
envelope to keep her
clippings will be just
the thing.</p>

<p>Take a piece of brown
linen ten and a half inches

Fold it in half so that it

and a half inches. Stamp a spray of daisies
or wild roses on one side and mark what the envelope
is supposed to hold, such as receipts or clippings.
Brown linen does not soil as easily as white.
Embroider the flowers and the lettering, then dampen
the linen thoroughly and press on the wrong side.
Now take two pieces of cardboard that measure
eight and a half inches by four and three quarters.
Cover the cardboard with the linen, use long stitches<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
as described in the needle case, except that two
pieces of the cardboard are placed side by side on
the brown linen. Now take two pieces of brown
paper the same size as
the cardboard and cover
the stitches. Paste
should be used to make
the paper stick to the
linen.</p>

Connect the dot to the corner by a line. Cut the
paper along the lines. Fold the ends in, then fold
the bottom flap over these and paste. Fold the
top flap over without pasting (<a href="#Fig159">Figure 159</a>).</p>

<p>Now, holding these six envelopes in the case with
bottom edges touching the space between the two
cardboards, punch three holes through linen, cardboard,
and envelopes.</p>

<p>Take a half a yard of ribbon and run through the
holes and tie the ends in a bow on the corner.</p>

<p>Take another half a yard of ribbon and cut in
two. Fasten a piece on each side of the cover

<h2><a name="XVII" id="XVII"></a>XVII<br /><br />
<small>HARDANGER EMBROIDERY FOR SQUARES, PIN
CUSHIONS, AND SPREADS</small></h2>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">We have</span> to go back to the foreign embroideries
to find those that are beautiful and
yet substantial enough to last beyond the
usual life of a piece of fancy work. There is nothing
we have originated in embroidery on this side of
the world as rich as Hardanger work, and yet it is
comparatively little known. The background for
this work is a loosely woven material like scrim or
basket weave materials such as Java canvas or the
regular Hardanger canvas which is imported.</p>

<p>It is lots of fun working Hardanger in wool on
Java canvas as it goes so quickly, and after we have
learned the stitches we can work it on as fine a
canvas as we desire.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 200px;">
<a name="Fig161"></a><img src="images/i_211.jpg" width="200" height="235" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 161. The block </div>
</div>

<p>The simplest stitch is the block. Thread a large
tapestry needle with a piece of heavy wool. On
your piece of Java canvas work a little block. The
worsted is on the right side of the canvas, and then
taking a stitch over four threads of the canvas bring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
the needle up on the next opening to the right on the
same line as the first. Five stitches constitute a
block; a space of four threads is then
left and the next block started, (<a href="#Fig161">Figure
161</a>). A great deal of Hardanger
has these blocks running at
right angles to each other with no
space between the blocks. Mistakes
cause a great deal of trouble and
sometimes it is necessary to rip out quite a lot of
stitches before they can be rectified and for that reason
you must be very accurate in your counting.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 300px;">
<a name="Fig162"></a><img src="images/i_211a.jpg" width="300" height="267" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 162. The star</div>
</div>

<p>The star is another favourite figure in Hardanger
work (<a href="#Fig162">Figure 162</a>). Four stitches are taken
over four threads of the material,
side by side, then five
stitches over eight threads of
the material and then four
again. This forms one side
of the star. The second side
is made exactly the same only
that at the base of the thirteenth stitch the first stitch
of the second side starts forming a right angle. The
star has four sides as you will note in the diagram
of this stitch. Now count and see if there are twelve
threads on each of the inner sides of the star. If<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
you find any mistake go over it and straighten it
out. There must be twelve threads on each side.
Cut four from each corner. This will leave four
threads directly in the centre of each side. With
a piece of embroidery cotton about the weight
of a thread of your canvas weave the bars. The
weaving is very simple, over one and under the next
till the bars are woven. Some of these bars have
little knots on the outer centre edge of each.
They are called picots (pronounced pe-co) and they
are made somewhat like a French knot. The
bar is woven half way across and laying the needle
on the bar the thread is wound around the
needle point. Hold each twist down with the left
thumb (<a href="#Fig163">Figure 163</a>). The needle is drawn through
and the result is a little
knot on the thread near
the stitches. A little
stitch is taken into
the woven part of
the bar and the thread
carried over to the
other side of the
bar and another picot
made.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 400px;">
<a name="Fig163"></a><img src="images/i_212.jpg" width="400" height="362" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 163. The picot</div>
</div>

<p>For an ornamental stitch to be used on the material<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
between the stars or blocks make a diagonal
stitch like the first stitch in cross stitching
(<a href="#Fig164">Figure 164</a>).</p>

<p>Pin cushion tops are easy to make and the following
instructions are given for cushions about four or
five inches square. Take a square of scrim or Hardanger
canvas eight inches large. It will be necessary
to pull a thread so that the material will be
quite straight on the edges. Pull out four threads
about one and a quarter inches from the edge on
each side of the material. Turn a quarter-inch fold
on one side and crease the material again so as to
make a half-inch hem. Baste it down so that it
just touches the drawn threads. Repeat on the
four sides. Be sure that at the corner the double
thickness of drawn threads are exactly over each
other. We are now ready to hemstitch the hem.
Thread the needle with No. 90 sewing cotton.
Run the thread under the hem and holding the
double part of the hem toward you take up four
threads of the material. Pass the needle again
around this group and now into the hem. Continue
in this manner around the four sides. At
the corners it will be necessary to take up both
thicknesses of the material.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 400px;">
<a name="Fig164"></a><img src="images/i_214.jpg" width="400" height="143" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 164. A simple ornamental stitch </div>
</div>

<p>Crease the finished square in four. Count sixteen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
threads upon the crease from the hemstitching
and with lustre No. C or heavy linen thread "aa"
make a little block of
four strands of floss over
four threads of the material.
Make a flight of
eight blocks each at right
angles to the other. Now instead of continuing
in the same direction turn and work seven more
groups down and to the left. Turn again to the
left and work seven blocks for the third side of the
square. Six groups to the right of the third row
completes the square.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 400px;">
<a name="Fig165"></a><img src="images/i_214a.jpg" width="400" height="397" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 165. A good arrangement of picot</div>
</div>

<p>Now with your fine embroidery scissors cut close
to the stitches of the three blocks at each corner.
The cut threads are
drawn out. Four
more cuttings will be
necessary on each
side. They should be
made against the
stitches only; that is,
the threads that are
running in the same direction
as the stitches
should be cut. <a href="#Fig165">Figure 165</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
shows where the cuts were made and the
threads drawn out. The remaining threads are
woven. A mercerized or dull finished marking
cotton is used for the weaving. It may be either
the plain weaving or may have picots on each
side of the bar. Another pretty arrangement of
picots is to place them on one side of the bars so that
they appear in groups of four each facing the other
(<a href="#Fig165">Figure 165</a>).</p>

<p>Sometimes a lace stitch is used such as the spider
or simple loop stitch. Directions for making a
spider will be found in the chapter on lace stitches.
The loop stitch is made by taking a stitch in the
centre edge of each bar. Take a stitch just as if
you were buttonholing.</p>

<p>Buttonholing the edge is preferred by many to
hemstitching.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 150px;">
<a name="Fig166"></a><img src="images/i_215.jpg" width="150" height="295" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 166. The
pyramid stitch </div>
</div>

<p>A pretty stitch often seen bordering
a row of drawn work is made in
pyramid form. It can be as deep as
desired. First take a stitch over two
strands of the material then three, then
four, then five and down again to two
(<a href="#Fig166">Figure 166</a>). This stitch must be
worked of course before any of the threads are
drawn.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span></p>

<p>If a little larger and more elaborate square is
wanted, take a piece of material nine or ten inches
square. Make a star, skip four threads and work the
open squares described for the smaller pin cushion.</p>

<p>On the opposite side of the square, directly across
from the first star, skip four threads and make another
square. At the other two corners of the
square make a star (<a href="#Fig167">Figure 167</a>).</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<a name="Fig167"></a><img src="images/i_216.jpg" width="600" height="624" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 167. The Hardanger square pin cushion</div>
</div>

<p>The German peasant girls are proud of their
aprons with a border of Hardanger embroidery.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
It is a common thing for them to have a border
fifteen or eighteen inches deep. Often they will
make yards and yards of a pattern, say four inches
wide, and they will insert it above the hems on sheets
and towels and cut out the background material.</p>

<p>There is no nation on earth as thrifty as the
Germans. A German girl I know who is only nineteen
years old has her entire bedroom fitted up with
Hardanger articles that she has made herself.
First there is the bedspread and bolster, each most
elaborately embroidered with an all-over design.
Then there is a round pillow (the edge buttonholed)
and a square pillow as well as the bureau scarf and
pin cushion. If she bought the articles already
worked she would have paid hundreds of dollars for
the outfit, while the actual cost was only a few dollars.
Nearly all the best of fancy-work shops sell
small pamphlets on Hardanger work that are not expensive
and after one is familiar with the foundation
stitches it is an easy matter to follow the designs
they give.</p>

<h2><a name="XVIII" id="XVIII"></a>XVIII<br /><br />
<small>APPLIQU&Eacute; ON LINEN AND OTHER MATERIALS
AND HEDEBO EMBROIDERY</small></h2>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Appliqu&eacute;</span>, or laying one material on another
and stitching or embroidering
them together is one of the simplest forms
of embroidery that even the Indians years ago knew
how to do. How many of you have not seen on an
Indian woman queer shapes cut out of leather and
ornamented with beads used for a border on her skirt?</p>

<p>There are two kinds of appliqu&eacute;, underlaid and
overlaid. Most of the work is the latter kind. The
underlaid is a little more difficult to do. It will
be explained at greater length later in this chapter.</p>

<p>Appliqu&eacute; is such easy work that you will almost
think it a mistake not to have heard about it before,
but after all it is really necessary that we should
know the simpler embroidery stitches before we
attempt an appliqu&eacute; piece, so that we can decorate
it in the manner to suit ourselves.</p>

<p>The European peasants work some of the crudest
specimens of appliqu&eacute;, yet their colour schemes and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
choice of material are good. For instance, Russian
crash, which is sold at the towel department of
many of our large department stores, from twelve to
twenty cents a yard, and which is very narrow,
usually about sixteen inches wide, is often employed
as the background of their porti&egrave;res.</p>

<p>Before the Russo-Japanese War it was possible to
get Russian crash as wide as forty inches. It is made
by the peasants in their homes from the waste ends
left from weaving linens. You have no doubt read of
how poor Russian peasants live in hovels in the same
room with the cow, if they are fortunate enough to
possess one, and their pigs. Necessarily the work
they do is not very clean but the artistic qualities
of the crash overcomes the fact of the dirt.</p>

<p>The better class of peasants will take three strips
of crash and connect them together with coarse
sewing or lace stitches and then apply circles of
broadcloth, or coloured linens on them. Other
geometrical figures are often applied.</p>

<p>I heard of a Southern family the other day who
are so thrifty that they allow nothing to go to waste,
not even the old coats and trousers that have played
the double r&ocirc;le of clothing the father and then have
been cut down for Johnny. After Johnny has had
all the wear possible out of them Grandma again<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
cuts them, this time in the shape of leaves, and
sews them on a large muslin circle, one overlapping
the other. This forms a mat for the dining room.
I am telling you this story not that you may
imitate it, but rather to let you know that after all
we have women here that are as clever and thrifty
with their needles as the European women.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<a name="Fig168"></a><img src="images/i_220.jpg" width="600" height="480" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 168. A pillow in Hedebo embroidery </div>
</div>

<p>For appliqu&eacute; work the design is cut out and the
wrong side covered almost to the edge with a paste
made of starch and water.</p>

<p>When a complicated piece of appliqu&eacute; is to be
worked, stamp your design on the background.
Then on the right side of the material to be appliqu&eacute;d,
or on the wrong side of velvet, lay a piece of transfer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
paper. Place the design on them. With a blunt
pointed instrument go over the line firmly till you
have a tracing of the design. If the lines are not
quite clear go over them with a pencil.</p>

<p>Cut out each piece and paste it to the background.
The edges may be machine stitched or satin-stitched
or outlined. A cord, also the couching stitch, makes
a good finish.</p>

<p>Very clever representations of animals can be
made by appliqu&eacute;. Take a duck, for instance.
The breast can be white felt, the head dark green
velvet. The wings dark brown and the back
and tail a lighter brown broadcloth. The legs and
the bill should be canary-coloured taffeta silk. Cut
each section so that it slightly laps over the
other.</p>

<p>Appliqu&eacute; underlaid is accomplished by stamping
the design on the wrong side of the material and
then cutting it out. The background is left intact
like a stencil. A piece of material of a different
colour is laid under the cut piece of material. The
raw or cut edges may be treated in many ways.
The material may be turned back and stitched by
machine or the edges may be finished with buttonholing
stitches, couching, fine satin-stitch or chain
stitch. The turning back of the cut edges requires<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
that they be neatly done or the embroidery will not
show to its best advantage.</p>

<p>Hedebo embroidery is in no way connected with
appliqu&eacute; work, but like the latter it is a branch of
needlework that few people in America understand.
Without exception it is the most elaborate form of
white work. The stitches give the effect of being
very difficult, but this is not so. The work requires
a lot of time and careful planning of the stitches for
which buttonhole stitch is usually the foundation.</p>

<div class="caption">Fig. 170. Part of a Hedebo collar</div>
</div>

<p>Hedebo is worked on a finely woven linen. The
design is stamped directly on the material. A
thread of D.M.C. No. 25 or spool linen thread outlines
the figures. Within the design, the linen is cut<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
one eighth of an inch from the running thread.
This eighth-inch extension is then turned under the
stitches and basted down. A small piece of dark
green oilcloth is then laid under the figure to be
worked and basting stitches hold the material and
oilcloth together. The oilcloth protects the fingers
and it is often used by foreigners in making eyelets.
A small piece is used and it is moved as many times
as necessary. A large piece is too clumsy to hold.
On the extreme double edge of the opening of the
design fine buttonholing stitches are taken. The
stitches are about one thirty-second of an inch apart.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span></p>

<p>A section of a design suitable for a collar is shown
here and the stitches will now be explained that have
been used on it (<a href="#Fig170">Figure 170</a>).</p>

<p>A bar is formed by laying two or three threads
so that they span the opening from side to side.
Over these threads fine buttonholing is worked.</p>

<p>The little triangles are worked by making seven
or nine stitches into as many of the buttonhole
stitches. The second row is worked into the first,
one stitch from each end is omitted. Continue in
this way to the point (<a href="#Fig171">Figure 171</a>).</p>

<p>The three large loops that separate the pyramids
or triangles from each other in the two outer circles
are worked by making two loops that will each take
up half the space between the triangles. These
loops are whipped two or three times to make them
heavier and then they are covered with buttonholing.
Work the first and half of the second and then make
the loop for the third or last and work it also in buttonholing,
then finish the second (<a href="#Fig172">Figure 172</a>). The
centre of the circle is made by connecting the opposite
triangles and loops together. Gently distribute
the threads from the centre to allow a small opening.
Put a thread around this opening and neatly
buttonhole the threads.</p>

<p>The middle figure is made by working a row of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
open buttonholing then running a drawing thread
into the loops and buttoning this band with tiny
stitches.</p>

<div class="caption">Fig. 171. Triangle in Hedebo
embroidery </div>
</div>

<p>The stitches of the middle circle are somewhat
simpler than the ones just
described. A circle of open
stitches is made directly
under the buttonhole stitches
on the material. Divide
this circle in eight parts and
make a large loop at alternate
eighths. A connecting
thread at the centre base of
each loop connects each opposite
pair of loops. The
triangles are worked from
the centre to the outer
edge.</p>

<p>The open triangles are
made by working a row of
open loops around the
three sides. The loops
are drawn slightly together with another thread.</p>

<div class="caption">Fig. 172. Buttonholed loops </div>
</div>

<p>There are many pretty edges that can be used as
finishes for work. The linen pieces, however, have
to be hemmed first and then the fancy edge put on.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
An edge of pyramids is attractive. An edge of buttonholed
loops with a picot in the centre of each bar
as described on Hardanger is also good. Sometimes
the loop or pyramid may need stretching in
shape. Take a pin in the lower centre and pull
the edges out the desired size.</p>

<p>In turning curves an extra little loop may have to
be worked so as not to crowd the large points.</p>

AND CUFFS SETS, ALSO SIMPLE DRAWN-WORK
STITCHES</small></h2>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Drawn</span> work is another of the fascinating
branches of fancy work and when used in
combination with embroidery it greatly
enriches the piece. Suppose now that you wanted
to make a handkerchief and yet did not want to
take the time to buttonhole the four edges. Well
there is nothing more appropriate than hemstitching.
The very expensive handkerchiefs only have two
threads drawn before hemstitching them but it
will be easiest to
hemstitch when
more threads are
pulled.</p>

<p>Handkerchief
linen that can be
bought from one
dollar up per yard
is of course the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
correct thing to use, but lawn or fine china silk is
often substituted.</p>

<p>A third of a yard of linen thirty-six inches wide
will make three handkerchiefs. A thread will have
to be drawn so that the squares will be perfectly
straight. A twelve-inch square of linen will make
a nice little handkerchief. Narrow hems not more
than one-quarter inch wide are more generally used
at present so we will plan our handkerchief for that.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 400px;">
<a name="Fig174"></a><img src="images/i_228.jpg" width="400" height="311" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 174. Hemstitching, second step</div>
</div>

<p>Measure up from the edge of one side five eighths
of an inch and draw
out four threads one
at a time. The other
three sides must also
be treated in like
manner. After measuring
the first side
with the tape measure
the other sides
are more accurately measured by turning up one
corner of the side that has the thread drawn so
that it forms a right angle. The upper edge of the
angle must just touch the drawn threads. Crease
firmly along the diagonal as shown in the diagram.
Now with the piece still folded over pull the first
thread of the second side of the handkerchief so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
that the corner when turned back forms a perfect
square (<a href="#Fig173">Figure 173</a>).</p>

<p>When the threads of the four sides have been
drawn fold back one eighth of an inch, then make a
double fold so that the hem is just one-quarter inch
wide. Baste it down so that the folded edge lies
right under the drawn threads. With your needle
threaded with a piece of No. 100 sewing cotton,
start from one corner. Let the end of your
threaded needle fall between the two thicknesses
of the material. Bring the needle through the
edge of the hem. Work from right to left; pass
the needle under four of the upright threads. Now
pass again under the same group of four threads,
but this time carry the needle through the edge.
Hem directly on a line with the fourth thread of
the group (<a href="#Fig174">Figure 174</a>).</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<a name="Fig175"></a><img src="images/i_229.jpg" width="500" height="348" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 175. Another way to hemstitch </div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span></p>

<p>Another way is to hold the material with the
hem toward you and work from left to right. Pass
the needle under four threads letting the thread in
the needle fall under the point of the needle. Pull
the needle through, thus forming a loop and taking a
stitch into the hem in the usual way (<a href="#Fig175">Figure 175</a>).</p>

<p>If your thread gives out or breaks, start the next
thread by working over two or three of the stitches.</p>

<p>In hemstitching the corners take up four of the
double threads.</p>

<p>When hemstitching on coarser material more
threads can be drawn and also a greater number of
threads can be taken up
when working.</p>

<p>Dainty little collar and
cuffs sets can be made by
hemstitching the hems:
and a quarter of an
inch above this work
make a row of French
knots or feather-stitching.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 400px;">
<a name="Fig176"></a><img src="images/i_230.jpg" width="400" height="281" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 176. Double hemstitching </div>
</div>

<p>Sometimes when a very open effect is desired it
is necessary to double hemstitch the threads. This
is very simple. Hemstitch in the usual way, then
turn the work and take up each group on the other
side of the drawn threads (<a href="#Fig176">Figure 176</a>).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span></p>

<p>Drawn work is worked to perfection in Mexico.
There they have large classes for the mountain
children who do most elaborate pieces on frames.</p>

<p>Hemstitching is not always necessary in doing
drawn work. Many beautiful borders can be made
with simple stitches.</p>

<p>The sheaf stitch (<a href="#Fig177">Figure 177</a>) is made by pulling
the threads for a space of a quarter of an inch or
more. Decide the width that you desire and then
cut the threads perpendicularly. Draw the first
and last thread to the distance desired, and then cut
opposite end to match the first slash. After the
threads have been drawn out neatly buttonhole the
cut edges with narrow buttonhole stitches. Now
place your work in your embroidery
hoops, or, better still,
if it is possible, buy a pair of
oval ones that are especially
made for drawn work. Fasten
thread in the centre of one
of the buttonholed sides.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 300px;">
<a name="Fig177"></a><img src="images/i_231.jpg" width="300" height="176" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 177. The sheaf stitch</div>
</div>

<p>The number of threads to take up will depend on
the coarseness of the weave of the material. For
medium weight linen take up either six or eight
threads using a stitch like that shown in the first
step of the second method of hemstitching. Pass<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
on to the next stitch and when the row is finished
fasten in the second buttonholed side. The
thread that passes from sheaf to sheaf should lie
straight enough so as not to sag between each group
or pucker the material.</p>

<p>Another pretty stitch that reminds one of a fish
bone is worked
somewhat like
feather-stitching.</p>

<p>Prepare the
space as for the
sheaf stitch.
Connect the
thread in the same way. Take up six threads on
the left hand side placing the thread under the point
of the needle as it comes through. Now on the
right hand side divide the group made by the first
stitch in half and take the last three threads and the
three next to it that are not worked (<a href="#Fig178">Figure 178</a>).</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 500px;">
<a name="Fig178"></a><img src="images/i_232.jpg" width="500" height="289" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 178. A simple stitch in drawn work </div>
</div>

<p>A simple stitch is the twist stitch (<a href="#Fig179">Figure 179</a>).
Prepare the material in the same way as for the
last two stitches and securely fasten your needle
in the centre of the bar, skip the first three threads.
Take up the next three on your needle; pass the
needle back under the first three. Continue like
this till the end of the row is reached.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span></p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 400px;">

<div class="caption">Fig. 179. The twist-stitch</div>
</div>

<p>A dainty all-over effect suitable for yokes or
corners of handkerchiefs, cloths, etc., is made by
drawing the threads out so that the material left
forms squares. Pull a quarter inch of threads then
leave a half inch of
material. Repeat in
this manner until the
space is covered.
Cross the lines, forming
squares of the material
(<a href="#Fig180">Figure 180</a>).</p>

<p>The double hemstitching, sheaf-stitch, fishbone,
or twist stitch can be worked on the drawn
threads. You will note that you will have at each
corner of the solid squares an open quarter-inch
square. They will require an extra stitch such as
the spider described in the lace stitches or the loop
stitch described in the Hardanger chapter.</p>

<p>Sometimes it is hard pulling the threads of linen.
If the threads are soaped they come out very easily.
Do not wet the soap but just rub it dry on the
material.</p>

<p>Some of the finest examples of hand embroidery
or drawn work are found in the convents. Perhaps
you are under the impression that drawn work must
be done right with the hem, but that is not so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>. I
want to describe a beautiful handkerchief to you
that I once saw in a convent. It was made of the
sheerest handkerchief linen and one thread only had
been pulled for the hemstitching. A quarter of
an inch above the hem another thread was drawn,
but this time, instead of letting it extend to the hem,
a thread was cut one quarter of an inch from the
hem at the beginning and ending. Six threads
were drawn like this at eighth of an inch spaces.
The four sides were treated in like manner.</p>

<div class="caption">Fig. 182. Five rows of tape cat-stitched </div>
</div>

<p>Where the threads intersected at the corner, the
squares were hemstitched all around, two stitches
being allowed to each side of the square.   The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
stitches were taken through to the centre of each
square. Beyond where the lines intersected the
six long lines were treated quite differently. A
piece of fine braid not more than an eighth of an
inch wide was taken on the space between the first
two rows of drawn threads. A regular cat-stitch was
worked over this. First a stitch was taken on the
drawn threads above the braid, then, one below it
(<a href="#Fig181">Figure 181</a>). When the braid was entirely covered
with stitches on the first row, a second piece of tape
or braid was placed over the space between the
second and third rows of drawn threads. This
time instead of catching the
thread of both rows, the
stitches are taken into
those of the previous row on one side of the tape
and into the third row of drawn threads on the other
side of the tape. Five rows of tape complete
the band between the stitches. Of course all this
work is on the wrong side of the handkerchief. On
the right side, a
totally different effect
is produced.
At first glance you
would think that
there are five rows<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
of tiny tucks with hemstitching on each side,
until you look again closely and see that it is
padded hemstitching (<a href="#Fig182">Figure 182</a>).</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 424px;">
<a name="Fig183"></a><img src="images/i_236.jpg" width="424" height="600" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 183. A handkerchief for an ambitious little girl </div>
</div>

<p>A section of a drawn work handkerchief for some
ambitious little girl to own is shown in the illustration
on this page (<a href="#Fig183">Figure 183</a>).   It is like a cobweb.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
A piece of handkerchief linen twelve inches square
is selected. Starting from the outer edge of the
four sides an eighth of an inch wide space is left, then
the threads drawn for an eighth of an inch. Repeat
this seventeen times. At the corners the space and
drawn threads form squares.</p>

<p>Now the rest of the space should be divided
up in like manner, so starting from one corner of the
solid square in the centre, draw the threads for an
eighth of an inch, then leave a space the same length
and then draw again. Continue in this manner
on the four sides of the centre square. Pull out all
the cut threads and you find that you have a deep
border of little squares. Buttonhole around the
four sides of the centre square with tiny stitches, thus
keeping the linen from fraying.</p>

<p>To get the pointed edge as shown in the handkerchief,
buttonhole over the line of horizontal
threads and four of the vertical. The little filling
stitch I am going to suggest to you is so simple
that really after you have buttonholed the handkerchief
your task is almost completed.</p>

<p>Start in the first point under the solid square and
work diagonally across the open space. Pass your
thread around the centre of the little square also
on the diagonal. Continue across till you reach<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
the buttonholed edge around the linen square in
the centre.</p>

<p>Skip the next point and work the same stitch
in every other point. This stitch and in fact all
the rest of the handkerchief should be carried out in
No. 200 sewing cotton.</p>

<p>In between the worked points make another
stitch which is very similar to the one just described.</p>

<p>It is started from the edge and a stitch is taken
on the diagonal across four of the squares and half
way across the solid squares at the corner of each
group.</p>

<p>Having reached the buttonholing next the linen
you turn your work and repeat the stitch over the
same square. The stitches now form the figure 8.</p>

<p>The design of drawn work in the centre of the
square is simple as well as being particularly
pleasing. Draw the threads for a half-inch space,
one quarter of an inch above the buttonholing.
This must be done on the four sides of the square.
The corners must be buttonholed before beginning
the drawn work. Start the first thread for the drawn
work in the centre of one of the buttonholed corners.
Work the sheaf stitch all the way across. Now
start a second thread, knotting the first sheaf in
three, the next in two; so on to the end. These<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
stitches are taken quite close to the linen. Both
sides of the sheaf stitch are treated the same.</p>

<p>The daisy in the corner completes the pattern.
The daisy is made on the foundation of cross-stitches
caused by the sheaf stitch. A Maltese cross is
made thus forming twelve stitches catching all
these together in the centre. Now weave a thread
around in a circle, one eighth of an inch from the
centre. To form the petals of the daisy start a
thread from one of the threads that connect with
the buttonholing and catch on the woven circle
as you would if you were doing fagotting.</p>

<p>Wherever threads are drawn so that they intersect
at right angles, as in the case of this handkerchief,
a space is left vacant which is very unsightly if not
filled in with some figure. Here it was with the
daisy which is extremely easy but in the majority
of cases it is with the Maltese cross.</p>

<p>The wide strip of drawn work shows a pretty
pattern for linen scarfs. It is nothing but right that
every girl should take an interest in her bedroom.
She may not be fortunate enough to have one entirely
by herself but that does not excuse her from
trying to make it as attractive as possible. The
key-note to beauty and elegance is simplicity.
Better have a dainty bureau scarf hand made and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
a few necessary toilet articles than a bureau beribboned
and with a lace scarf, crowded with old visiting
cards, dance orders, and dainty nothings that
only catch the dust and give one a bewildered feeling
when one looks at them. The scarf should be worth
displaying if it is hand work, for remember what is
worth doing is worth doing well.</p>

<p>The butterfly pattern of drawn work (<a href="#Fig184">Figure
184</a>) is simple and pretty enough to please the
most exacting and as has been said before is most
appropriate for bureau scarfs. The material of
the scarf may be linen, lawn, or scrim. It is quite
unnecessary that the drawn work extend around
the whole scarf&mdash;three sides, one long and the two
short, being quite sufficient.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<a name="Fig184"></a><img src="images/i_240.jpg" width="600" height="199" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 184. The butterfly pattern in drawn work </div>
</div>

<p>Draw the threads out for an inch, then hemstitch
the cloth on both sides of the space; be sure to
take up the group of threads already hemstitched
when working on the second side. Fasten the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
thread in the direct centre of one end of the drawn
work and catch eight groups of threads to form the
sheaf stitch. An eighth of an inch above the centre
thread start another thread. Divide the sheaf
in thirds and knot each section of the first sheaf.
Pass the thread to the second sheaf and repeat the
same thing, this time under the centre instead of
above it. Alternate sheaves are divided above
the centre line and the remaining sheaves
under.</p>

<p>A third thread is started beginning an eighth of
an inch below the centre and the other side of the
sheaf is divided in three.</p>

<p>A fourth thread is started one eighth of an inch
from the solid material. This time the sheaf is
divided in four, in groups of two. First the top
of one sheaf is woven like this, then the bottom of
the next. Continue in this manner till the end
of the strip is reached.</p>

<p>The fifth thread knots the groups on the side of
each sheaf that was omitted by the fourth thread.</p>

<p>You will notice now that the four threads cross
each other in the centre of the space between each
sheaf. Knot the threads in the centre and weave
across the lower four threads until you have made
as large a fan as the space will allow. The remaining<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
threads are divided in two, three on each side,
and two other fans are woven on them.</p>

<p>In the next space the fan of four is reversed and
is made in the opposite direction to the first group.
This pattern is commonly termed the butterfly
pattern.</p>

<p>Drawn work should be worked on frames, though it
is not necessary to use the large square one of the
Mexicans. The nicest kind of frame and one easy
to handle is the oval form, which comes in different
sizes. They are particularly convenient to hold
a long, narrow piece, which can be worked to
better advantage than on the round rings.</p>

<p>Every once in awhile one sees specimens of a
new kind of drawn work. There is the Mexican
of which we have had a few of the simplest
stitches, there is the Hardanger or Swedish drawn
work, which is described in another chapter, the Porto
Rico drawn work which is very intricate and also very
trying to the eyes, but after all none compares in
simplicity to the Bulgarian drawn work. It is so
substantial that often after the material of the article
on which the work is done has worn out, the drawn
work is as good as new and can be transferred to
another piece of material.</p>

<p>Bulgarian drawn work instead of weakening the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
material as Mexican work usually does strengthens
it considerably.</p>

<p>The work is done in spaces varying from a half
inch to three inches in width. It can be done on
linen, huck or lawn backgrounds, though sometimes
scrim is used. Personally I do not think it pays
to work elaborate patterns on scrim as the background
is not substantial enough.</p>

<p>We will take for example the first towel end shown
in this work.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<a name="Fig185"></a><img src="images/i_243.jpg" width="600" height="210" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 185. A towel in Bulgarian drawn work </div>
</div>

<p>Draw threads out of an inch and a half space.
It is not necessary that the cloth should be hemstitched,
though till you are quite familiar with the
work it may be easier for counting. The hem is
then turned over and hemstitched. Make the
double hemstitch on the other side as described in
the first part of this chapter.</p>

<p>I have found that though there are many threads
that may be used for weaving there is nothing quite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
as satisfactory as Electro in its finest number.
Start from the extreme lower left hand corner.
Weave back and forth over three of the groups with
a blunt pointed crewel needle for one quarter of
the distance from the hem. Now omitting the first
group weave across three. You will see that you
dropped the first group and took up the fourth.
Weave to the middle of the space. Now drop the
second group and weave across to the fifth group
until you are three quarters across the space. Now
drop the third group and weave across to the sixth.
Weave until the space is filled. Without breaking
your thread weave the seventh, eighth and ninth,
then the eighth, ninth and tenth, next the ninth,
tenth and eleventh, then the tenth, eleventh and
twelfth. Weaving the eleventh, twelfth and thirteenth
brings you back again to the hem.</p>

<p>The woven threads will look somewhat like an
arch of blocks. Between the arch there are six
groups of threads. Let us weave that in pyramid
effect. Start at the hem and weave across the six
for a little more than a quarter of an inch. Then
dropping the first and last groups of threads of the
proposed pyramid weave over four threads for
another quarter of an inch. Again dropping the
first and last threads of the four you were weaving,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
work across two. Fasten your thread by bringing it
through the woven stitches into the hem. A new
thread is started in like manner. You are now
ready to start another arch, close to one just
made.</p>

<p>A little more elaborate design is shown in the
second towel end, a detail of which is also given
(Figures <a href="#Fig186">186</a> and <a href="#Fig187">187</a>.)</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">

<div class="caption">Fig. 186. Detail of Fig. 187</div>
</div>

<p>After the threads have been prepared as has
been just described for the first towel start from the
lower left hand side and weave across the threads
eight times. The weaving is very simple. First
you take two groups with needle pointing to the
left and then you take the one group that you didn't<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
take up the first time. You work back and forth
as it were.</p>

<p>Now drop the first thread and weave across to the
fourth group as in the first towel. Each set of three
groups will only have eight lines however. Continue in
this manner till you are one space from the solid material,
then weave across four instead of three. Start to
weave down on the right side over the three groups
under the block of four. Now continue weaving over
groups of three until the hem is almost reached then
weave the last block over four (See detail of <a href="#Fig187">Figure 187</a>).</p>

<p>On each side of these blocks weave a row working
over two groups.</p>

<div class="caption">Fig. 187. A more elaborate design in Bulgarian drawn work</div>
</div>

<p>The groups of thread within the woven rows are
woven into a triangle.</p>

<p>Bulgarian drawn work is used on pillow cases, handkerchiefs,
towels, dresses, scarfs, or small square cloths.</p>

<p>Sometimes coloured threads are used and the
result is very effective. Use cottons and if they
are coloured boil them in salt and water before
working with them.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">One</span> of our best authorities on lace has said
that there are over one hundred different
stitches used in lace. Now there are
various kinds of laces; there are crochetted, bobbin,
as well as needle point laces. It is about two
branches of needlework laces&mdash;Renaissance and
point&mdash;that we will talk about in this chapter.</p>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 400px;">

</div>

<p>Renaissance lace is made by basting a flat braid
on a given pattern and filling the spaces between
with simple lace stitches. Point lace is made of
very fine plain braid with much finer thread and
more elaborate stitches.</p>

<p>The basting of the braid is extremely important.
Sometimes only a single line is given to indicate
where the braid will be, while again a double line
is shown. The braid must not be wider than the
double lines. It may be basted so that the side<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
held toward you will be the right side of the lace
or <i>vice versa</i>. Start from one corner of the design,
turn over one end of the braid an eighth of an
inch. For coarse work one row of basting stitches
through the centre of the braid is sufficient but for
fine work baste
along both edges of
the braid.</p>

<p>In basting around
a loop the inner
edge of the braid
will have to be gathered.
This may be
done in two ways:
the first by pulling
a thread or by running
a thread on the
edge. At a sharp
point the braid will
have to be turned.</p>

<p>The preferred
method of working
the lace is to have
the right side facing you. In starting to braid
turn up one eighth inch of braid and start from
a point so that the end may be covered later.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span></p>

<p>The braids vary from one cent to fifteen cents per

<p>A simple stitch in lace that greatly resembles the
Turkish stitch in embroidery is fagotting. It is a
stitch that is often used by dressmakers to connect
bias bands together for yokes and sleeves. For this as
well as other lace stitches
the beginning of the
thread should be fastened
so as to be unobserved
by the average eye.
If the braid is neatly
over-casted the end will
be quite secure. Starting
from the extreme
left of the section to
be fagotted take a
stitch through the braid
on the opposite side of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
the opening, letting the thread fall to the right.
The stitches are taken from side to side. This
stitch is best suited to long narrow spaces
(<a href="#Fig188">Figure 188</a>).</p>

<p>The foundation stitch of lace is the single mesh or
net stitch. It is a stitch that may be used in almost
any shape opening. It is a good thing when working
a piece of lace to pick out one stitch for filling in the
background; then
the design proper
can be as fancy
as desired.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 500px;">
<a name="Fig190"></a><img src="images/i_250.jpg" width="500" height="488" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 190. A handkerchief in simple lace
stitches </div>
</div>

<p>The mesh or net
stitch is good for
a filling stitch. A
blunt pointed
needle is the best
for working lace
as you are not so
apt to stick yourself.
Make a row
of open buttonholing, not however through the
background. The second row is worked slightly
below the first row. Each stitch is taken into a loop
of the upper row. If the spaces decrease in size
drop one stitch from each end for as many rows as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
necessary. To finish the stitches overcast them
to the braid. To many lace makers this stitch is
known as single Brussels (<a href="#Fig189">Figure 189</a>).</p>

<p>Double Brussels or the knot is worked like the
single only that there is a second stitch taken in the
same position as the first.
The last must be short
and drawn tightly (<a href="#Fig191">Figure
191</a>).</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 400px;">
<a name="Fig191"></a><img src="images/i_251.jpg" width="400" height="477" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 191. Double Brussels stitch </div>
</div>

<p>Another pretty filling-in
stitch is the spider.
It can be as large as desired
allowing the space
it is to be used in to determine
the size. A thread
is spanned across the
space and the braid
whipped for a short distance, say a quarter of
an inch. The space is spanned again so that the
threads cross. Pick up all the threads on the
needle through the centre and make a little stitch
to bind them. Now begin to weave over one leg
or strand and under another, so on till a good-sized
body is formed to the spider. In weaving
be careful not to skip one of these little legs
(<a href="#Fig192">Figure 192</a>).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span></p>

<p>Another way to work a spider, to make it a little
stronger is to whip each leg as it is spanned.</p>

<p>A third and more
elaborate spider is one
made with the foundation
thread as described
for the first
spider and then instead
of weaving
straight around make
a stitch back over one
leg and forward under two until the body is the
desired size. This is called the spider in its web
(<a href="#Fig193">Figure 193</a>).</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 400px;">
<a name="Fig192"></a><img src="images/i_252.jpg" width="400" height="296" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 192. The simple spider </div>
</div>

<p>It is easier to weave on an uneven number of
threads, and the number of
these should depend on the
space. A large space requires
a large spider with lots of legs.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 300px;">
<a name="Fig193"></a><img src="images/i_252a.jpg" width="300" height="385" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 193. The woven spider </div>
</div>

<p>A fan (<a href="#Fig194">Figure 194</a>) is made by
spanning three or five threads so
that they come to a common
centre on one side and on the
other they are arranged in ray
effect. The weaving is started from the base under
one thread and over the other on the first row if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
there are only three. The second row is like the
first, only the threads skipped in the first row are
taken up. Alternate
rows agree.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 400px;">
<a name="Fig194"></a><img src="images/i_253.jpg" width="400" height="321" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 194. The fan</div>
</div>

<p>A Maltese cross looks
like four fans caught together.
The threads are
crossed lengthwise and
crosswise and the stitches
taken to gather the
threads in the centre. The weaving is the same as
the fans. In weaving the fans or crosses do not
work much more than half way up (<a href="#Fig195">Figure 195</a>).
A twisted bar is
nothing more than a
thread overcasted
(see illustration, <a href="#Fig124">Figure
124</a>).</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 400px;">
<a name="Fig195"></a><img src="images/i_253b.jpg" width="400" height="377" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 195. A Maltese cross </div>
</div>

<p>A buttonholed bar
is made by laying two
or three threads and
buttonholing over
them (<a href="#Fig196">Figure 196</a>).</p>

<p>In this age of machine
work there are all sorts of braids that may
be procured for lace work. Little edges that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
were impossible to buy are now made by machinery.</p>

<p>A little edging makes a dainty finish to a straight
braid and also enhances the beauty of the fancy
braids.</p>

<p>To make a simple edging, work a row of picots on
the edge of the braid which forms the edge of the
design.</p>

<p>Dainty yokes, collars, baby caps, and tie ends
can be made of a few yards of braid and two or three
different kinds of stitches.</p>

<p>Another decoration I would like to tell you a
little about is Limerick darning. It is often used
with fine lace work on a background of fine net.</p>

<p>The lace thread is used for the darning. The most
common of the stitches is the plain darning taken
up over one hole and under the next of the net.
The next row is
worked close to
the first.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 500px;">
<a name="Fig196"></a><img src="images/i_254.jpg" width="500" height="218" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 196. A buttonholed bar </div>
</div>

<p>Darning on net
is a decoration
that is often used
by itself. Smart little turn-over collars and cuffs
are most attractive darned in heavy white floss or
colour if preferred. Pin cushion covers and other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
dainty articles that every girl loves to have in her
bedroom may be darned to good effect.</p>

<p>One of the most simple forms of lace work is
Connemara lace. It gets its name from the Irish
county of that name.</p>

<p>The materials required are Brussels net of any size
desired, lace braid of a width to correspond with the
net, heavy lace rings, a ball of Renaissance thread
No. 60 or linen spool thread No. 25, as well as a
spool of coloured cotton.</p>

<p>Connemara lace is used extensively for curtains,
bed spreads and in fact, on any large piece, when
the effect is desired and yet not much work. A good
design for Connemara
lace is shown
in <a href="#Fig197">Figure 197</a>.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 500px;">
<a name="Fig197"></a><img src="images/i_255.jpg" width="500" height="463" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 197. A good design for Connemara lace </div>
</div>

<p>The net can be
white, ecru, or black.</p>

<p>Draw a simple yet
bold design on a
piece of stiff paper
or better still a piece
of pink or blue paper
muslin.</p>

<p>The rings can be bought all ready for applying,
for a couple of cents per dozen but they can also<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
be made at home. Take a pencil and wind around
one end of a thread about as many times as you
would judge from the illustration of the
button or ring half worked (<a href="#Fig198">Figure
198</a>). Slip the threads from the pencil
and carefully and closely go over them
with buttonhole stitches till all the loose
threads are completely covered.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 150px;">
<a name="Fig198"></a><img src="images/i_256.jpg" width="150" height="166" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 198
Button half
worked </div>
</div>

<p>Baste your net over the design, then baste the
braid along the design. With a fine thread secure
the braid on the extreme edge to the net only with
fine running stitches. Sew one side of the braid entirely
around the design then sew the other side
down.</p>

<p>The rings are buttonholed to the net.</p>

<p>If a very elaborate piece is wanted, lace stitches
may be inserted in spaces that are bound on all
sides with braid. The stitches, however, should be
of the simplest, such as the twisted bar or spider.</p>

<p>Honiton braid which is an egg-shaped braid is
much more beautiful than the plain Renaissance
braid employed in Connemara.</p>

<p>The dearest of baby caps, handkerchief tie ends,
and other dainty little articles on which a fine decoration
is desired can be made from fine net and
Honiton braid.   Each section of braid can be cut<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
and made to form petals for a flower or to represent
a leaf. Honiton is of course more expensive than
Renaissance braid but a yard of Honiton goes a good
way.</p>

<p>There is a thread that can be bought by the yard,
called picot or purling thread. It has a loop at
short intervals each side of it. The needle can be
threaded with it and can be used for stems, tendrils,
or other parts of a design where a fine single line
is desired.</p>

<p>The centre of a flower in Honiton appliqu&eacute; may
be in worked various ways. A small ring or button
may be used or spiders may be woven in the centre.
Again the single Brussels or mesh stitch is worked
in a little circle in the centre. Use a very small
ring, if you decide on rings for centre, as a large ring
spoils the effect of a flower. Any child can make
designs for Honiton appliqu&eacute;.</p>

<p>The background for Honiton is the fine Brussels
net. Sometimes a double thickness of net is basted
over the pattern and the Honiton sewed on or appliqu&eacute;d
to the net. The double thickness of net
gives a moire effect. Each section of the braid is
sewed to the net only. Sometimes two widths of
braid are used, one size for the flowers and another
for the leaves.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span></p>

<p>The braids at most art shops can be had in black,
cream, or white. If, however, you are not fortunate
enough to get cream, the white can be dyed at home
to be as light or deep as you desire. I use cold
tea diluted in water for a light cream, and coffee
for the deeper cream. Put the lace to soak in the
tea or coffee for a couple of hours. Rinse in cold
water and let dry. If it is not a deep enough shade
put more tea or coffee in the water and soak the
lace again. Another way to dye lace, chiffon or
any delicate fabric is to get a tube of oil paint the
colour you desire and dilute it in gasolene. Of
course the gasolene makes the paint light, so test
the solution by dipping a small piece of cloth in and
see if it is the right shade. A quart of gasolene is
sufficient unless the article is very large.</p>

<p>I know a girl who dipped her white hat all trimmed
with flowers and tulle that was quite soiled into a
mixture of gray paint and gasolene and the result
was a pretty dove gray that everybody thought
was new.</p>

<p>Teneriffe or Brazilian point lace is such a simple
form of lace making that I am going to stop
and tell you a few words about it before we proceed
to the next chapter.</p>

<p>Little forms which look like a large spool with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
pins stuck in them can be bought in many art shops,
but you can easily make a foundation yourself for
Teneriffe lace.</p>

<p>Draw a circle two inches in diameter on a stiff
piece of cardboard. Sometimes the circle is drawn
on white muslin and fastened securely to an embroidery
hoop or frame. Divide the circle into
halves, then quarters, then eighths and each eighth
divide into six equal parts. Make a dot at each
division. Thread a needle with a piece of coarse
thread. Insert the needle one quarter inch beyond
the circle and bring it up on a dot. Continue in
this manner all around the circle. Fasten securely.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 400px;">
<a name="Fig199"></a><img src="images/i_259.jpg" width="400" height="387" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 199. The first step in Brazilian
point lace </div>
</div>

<p>Now thread a needle
with a long thread of
No. 80 linen thread.
Let it be extra length.
Pass the needle under
each loop from side to
side until each little
stitch has a thread passing
through it. (<a href="#Fig199">Figure
199</a>). Knot the
threads in the centre
and weave four or five rows, over and under the
strands close to the centre. Skip a quarter inch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
then carry a thread around and knot each thread
as you pass it. Count the threads and divide the
number by six; on this number weave a little pyramid.
Repeat the little pyramid five times, each
time letting it be woven on the same number of
threads as the first. Take a thread and catch
every two threads above the centre figure. An
eighth of an inch above this work another row, this
time dividing the two threads previously caught and
taking one of them and one of the next row together.
An eighth of an inch above the row make another
row, catching the same threads as were taken in the
first row from the central figure (<a href="#Fig200">Figure 200</a>).</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span></p>

<p>Sometimes a pin cushion is used to make Brazilian
lace. The pins are stuck in and the threads wound
over them.</p>

<p>Brazilian or Teneriffe lace can be used for borders
on handkerchiefs or other fine articles, while again
they may be used as medallions on waists or other
thin clothes. The material from under them is
cut out so that a lacy effect may be produced.</p>

<p>Other patterns may be readily made. Remember
that the stitches are very similar to those used in
the corners of drawn work borders.</p>

<h2><a name="XXI" id="XXI"></a>XXI<br /><br />
<small>SIMPLE BASKETS</small></h2>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Basketry</span> is so easily done and at such a
small cost that almost any one, even a
very little child, can master it without very
much difficulty. With very few tools some beautiful
gifts and other useful articles may be made.</p>

<p>In this chapter it is my intention to tell little
children just how to make some pretty things with
materials that they can obtain from nature's storehouse
and otherwise.</p>

<p>In making baskets a great deal of rattan is used.
I suppose that some of my little readers will wonder
what rattan is. Well, I will tell you. It is a kind
of grass or leaf which grows in forests of foreign
countries, twining about the tress, hanging from
branch to branch sometimes hundreds of feet in
length but hardly ever over an inch thick. The
people over there in those countries send this material
to us so that we can make many pretty things.
For little boys and girls living in the country there
are materials which they can get from the fields<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
and river banks that may be substituted for
rattan.</p>

<p>For instance the water willow when peeled
proves a very good material. Reed, which is a
sort of grass that grows on the banks of rivers, may
also be used after it is dried and peeled. Raffia is
another material which is commonly used for this
work. It is a sort of soft substance generally pale yellow
and can be bought by the pound at any large store.</p>

<p>Dried grass is sometimes substituted for raffia
and the results are often just as pretty as those obtained
by the original material.</p>

<p>Grass twine is used. It is something like rope,
and rope is often substituted for it. Raffia is generally
used to cover it in making baskets.</p>

<p>A few tools will be necessary for our work such as
a strong pair of shears, a tape measure or ruler, a
vessel for water, and some very coarse, blunt-edged
needles.</p>

<p>Simple baskets of rattan are very interesting to
make and I will tell you how to make a small round
basket without a cover.</p>

<p>For this basket you will need four fourteen-inch
pieces of rattan or spokes as we are going to call
them, one eight-inch piece and two or three longer
pieces for weavers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span></p>

<p>Before starting the work, the rattan should be
soaked in water until it becomes soft enough to bend
easily. Then two of the pieces are placed side by
side in a vertical position and the other two in a
horizontal position crossing the vertical pieces at the
centre.   Between the two horizontal pieces and to
the right of the centre the half spoke is placed.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<a name="Fig201"></a><img src="images/i_264.jpg" width="400" height="416" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 201.   Weaving the bottom </div>
</div>

<p>These are held in position by the left hand, while
the right hand does the work.</p>

<p>One end of the long piece called the weaver is
placed at the centre, back of the horizontal spokes,
with the end toward the right. The first finger of
the right hand presses the weaver across the vertical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
spokes, under the horizontal on the left, over the
vertical, and behind the horizontal again. Repeat
twice so as to fasten well.</p>

<p>Separate the spokes evenly, and it is now ready
for the weaving (<a href="#Fig201">Figure 201</a>).</p>

<p>If there is any of the winding piece left, it may be
used as a weaver.</p>

<p>The weaving is done by pressing the weaver under
one spoke and over the other until the bottom of the
basket is about two and one half inches across.</p>

<p>Soak it in water for a few minutes and then bend
the spokes upward to form the sides of the basket.</p>

<p>In order to make the weaving of the sides of the
basket easier, rest the work on the knee, holding the
spokes with the left hand and press the weaver under
and over the spokes with the first finger of the right
hand. If the weaver comes to an end join a new
piece by crossing them behind a spoke about an
inch from the end of each.</p>

<p>When the sides of the basket have been woven,
leaving about an inch and a half of the spokes extending,
it is ready for the border.</p>

<p>Cut the spokes to an even length with a slanting
cut, so that the points may be easily pushed down
between the weaves. Hold the spokes in water
for a few minutes and then push one of the spokes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
down beside the next spoke at least three quarters
of an inch below the edge. Do this with every
spoke until the border has been completed. Now
our little basket is finished and ready for use.</p>

<p>Sometimes little girls like to have their baskets
brightened up. A pretty lining of silk or other
material would do this very nicely.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<a name="Fig202"></a><img src="images/i_266.jpg" width="600" height="322" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 202. The basket </div>
</div>

<p>Perhaps some children would like to know how
to make a basket with a cover. It only requires
a little more time but it will prove very interesting.</p>

<p>The material for this basket consists of six sixteen-inch
spokes, one spoke nine inches long and three
or four weavers.</p>

<p>The bottom of this basket is made in the same
way as the one previously described. After
this much has been done, wet the spokes and proceed
to turn them up and weave the sides of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
the basket. The weaving is done rather loosely
until you have used three of the weavers. The
last weaver is drawn more tightly so that the basket
will assume the shape of an apple with the top cut
off. The edge is finished off with a flat border which
may be made by soaking the spokes in water until
they become quite soft. Each spoke is brought
behind the next one to the right of it, and out over
the front of the basket. Then the end of each spoke
which is lying over the front of the basket is brought
up over the next spoke to the right and is pressed
down inside of the basket. When it is dry the
ends of the spokes
may be cut off.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 500px;">
<a name="Fig203"></a><img src="images/i_267.jpg" width="500" height="498" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 203. A mat </div>
</div>

<p>The cover is made
like the bottom of
the basket, only the
spokes are bent
gradually upward
from the centre.
The material for this
cover consists of six
fourteen-inch spokes,
one spoke seven or
eight inches long and two long pieces for weavers.</p>

<p>When the cover is nearly as large around as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
top of the basket it is finished off with a border like
the one described for the top of this basket. The
cover has to be fastened to the basket and the easiest
way of doing this is by making rings of rattan.</p>

<p>A piece of rattan about twelve inches long is
tied into a ring, the ends being twisted in and out
of the ring. Three rings are necessary, none of
them measuring more than a half or three quarters
of an inch across. One ring is attached to the cover
on the front between the border and the last row of
weaving, the ends being sewed under a spoke. Another
ring is attached in the same way at the back
of the cover and the third is fastened across a spoke
in the front of the basket between the fourth and
fifth rows of weaving. The cover is placed on the
basket so that the ring at the back will be just over
a spoke of the basket. A small piece of weaver is
then placed between the third and fourth rows of
weaving, below the border and to the left of the spoke
mentioned. It is brought through the ring on the
cover and drawn just tightly enough to allow the
cover to close easily. The ends are crossed and
brought through to the inside and sewed down,
as the rings were. When this is done the basket
is complete.</p>

<p>There are many other pretty articles that can be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
made easily, such as a mat for a teapot or lamp and
trays for other purposes (<a href="#Fig203">Figure No. 203</a>).</p>

<p>A very simple way to make a mat would be to
cut four fourteen-inch spokes of rattan, one eight-inch
spoke, and two weavers. The mat is started
in the same way as the first basket in this chapter.
When the end of the first weaver is reached, a second
is joined to it. By the time the second weaver has
been used, the mat is large enough for a border.
The mat has to be bound. The binding may be
done by passing the weaver under the last row of
weaving just before it reached the next spoke. It
then goes behind that spoke, in front of the next
and under the last row of weaving. The spokes
should then be soaked in water, and when soft take
spoke No. 1 and cross No. 2 and push it down beside
No. 3 and so on around the mat. A number of
these mats may be made and joined together for
various purposes. Two mats joined by ribbon make
a very pretty whisk-broom holder.</p>

<p>In nearly all this work weaving is the principal
thing. By changing the weave we can obtain very
interesting and pretty results. The simple over and
under weave may be changed by using two weavers
and twisting once, twice or three times between the
spokes according to the size of the article.</p>

<small>RAFFIA BASKETS AND NAPKIN RINGS</small></h2>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Raffia</span> is so soft and strong that it is very
well fitted for the work of children's fingers.</p>

<p>So many different things can be made
with raffia that it is just as precious to the little
ones as the same amount of gold.</p>

<p>Little baskets made of raffia are dainty and easily
made. For example a work basket, a candy basket,
or a basket for handkerchiefs, collar buttons, and
many things are interesting.</p>

<p>For one of these baskets we need one long piece
of rattan, a bunch of raffia and a blunt-pointed needle.
Soak the piece of rattan in water until it is soft
enough to work with. Wind the end into the smallest
possible ring and with the needle full of raffia start
in the middle of the ring and sew over and over from
left to right until the end is firmly fastened. The
next row is brought around at a little distance from
the first and the raffia is brought down through the
centre, up and once around the coil, thus holding
the first coil to the second.</p>

</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span></p>

<p>Wind the raffia around the rattan until the coil
has been brought half way around the second time,
when it is again sewed through the centre. At
quarter distance all the way through the basket
these joinings are made and they must be made to
the right of the one below and joined to the previous
row. The joinings form a pattern.</p>

<p>As the basket grows larger the number of joinings
increase. New needlefuls of raffia are always started
at a joining, the old strand being brought from left
to right through the upper part of the joining. The
new strands being brought from right to left through
two twists of raffia and drawn through so as to leave
the short end lying next to the rattan.</p>

<p>Begin to wind again and soon both ends are covered.
When you have made about ten rows, which
will form the bottom of the basket, bring the rattan
above the last row and proceed as before. Each new
row is brought above the previous one so as to form
the sides of the basket. When the basket is about
eight rows high, the ninth row is brought just a little
inside of the eighth so as to have something for the
cover to rest upon. When about three inches from
the point where the rattan was brought up to make
the sides of the basket, it should be cut long enough
to finish the row and then shaved off to a flat point<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
which is sewed closely to the last row. For this
basket we will have to make a cover.</p>

<p>The cover is made in the same manner as the
bottom of the basket. When you have nine rows
complete, a border is made to finish off the cover.
The tenth row is sewed to the ninth by a fancy
stitch which is made by winding once around the
ninth from left to right and once around the tenth
from right to left and so on alternately until the row
is completed.</p>

<p>The end of the rattan is shaved off and sewed to
the last row. A pretty lining would beautify this
article very much.</p>

<p>One of the very simple things which a very
small child could easily make is a napkin ring
(<a href="#Fig204">Figure 204</a>).</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 500px;">
<a name="Fig204"></a><img src="images/i_275.jpg" width="500" height="358" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 204. The napkin ring </div>
</div>

<p>Cut a piece of cardboard or stiff paper about an
inch and a half wide and eight or nine inches long.
Paste the ends together forming the ring. Take
two strands of raffia and knot them. Place the
knot inside the ring holding it with the first two
fingers of the left hand. The strand on the right
is brought up and across the ring on the top, the
end hanging over the left side. The strand on the
left is brought around the right strand under again
through the ring and out on the right through the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
loop made by the right strand in turning and crossing
the ring. Pull both ends. The strand on the
left is brought across the ring, the right strand
placed over it through the ring and out through
the loop on the opposite side. Pull both ends. The
little knot formed
on the edge is called
"Solomon's Knot"
and it makes a very
desirable edge.</p>

<p>Different colours
may be used in raffia
which brighten
the ring very much
and make the work more interesting.</p>

<p>When the strands of raffia come to an end, a new
one is joined by placing the end over the old one
about an inch or an inch and a half, and working with
them as one. The ends may be cut off after the ring
is finished. Sometimes a small bunch of raffia
about an inch long is tied to the outside of the
ring. The ends are frayed out to add to the effect.</p>

<p>There is one article which proves to be most
delightful and interesting to make (that is, to the
girls) a doll's hat (<a href="#Fig205">Figure 205</a>).</p>

<p>I think that nearly every little girl knows how to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
braid raffia and after you have learned how to sew
this braid together you can make any size or shape
in hats.</p>

<p>Braid some raffia, say about two or three yards.
Have several loose strands and a needle and scissors.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<a name="Fig205"></a><img src="images/i_276.jpg" width="600" height="380" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 205. A doll's braided hat </div>
</div>

<p>Just as in making large hats we begin with the
centre of the crown. A needle is threaded with a
fine strand of raffia and the work is begun by winding
the end several times with the end of the strand
threading the needle.</p>

<p>A coil is then started with the edge of the braid
up, not the face, and it is sewed through at least
two braids at a time, in stitches which run in the
direction of the braid. The needle is put in slanting
down from right to left and up in the opposite
direction. The crown is coiled round and round<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
until it is about two or two and a half inches large.
The coil is then brought round with the upper edge
just below the centre of the last row. The following
rows are sewed in the same way until the crown is
completed or high enough to suit you. Have care
in sewing the braid so as to show as little of the
stitches as possible. The brim is made by flattening
out the braid and sewing it so that it overlaps the
centre of the braid of each preceding row.</p>

<p>When the brim is wide enough one or two rows
are sewed more tightly than the others and the end
of the braid is sewed under the brim very flatly.
Now the hat is ready to be trimmed.</p>

<p>I would like to tell a little about the handles of
baskets in this chapter. In most of the baskets
already described a cover has been made. Some
people would rather have a handle to the basket, so
let us see if we cannot learn how to make some
handles. The twisted handle of rattan is made by
using one spoke of rattan of suitable length, and a
weaver. A knitting needle or something similar will
be necessary for the work.</p>

<p>The needle is pushed down beside a spoke of the
basket and then drawn out again to make room for
the end of the rattan to be pushed in, about three
inches below the top of the basket. The other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
end is inserted in the same way on the opposite
side. This makes the foundation handle. The
end of the weaver is inserted under the third row of
weaving to the left of the spoke and pushed up
between the weaving. It is twisted around the
foundation about an inch apart. When the opposite
side is reached, the weaver is pushed in under
the third row of weaving on one side of the handle
spoke and brought out on the other side. The
weaver is then laid across the first twist and each
of the following ones, to the other side where it goes
under the third row as on the opposite side. About
five or six times across will cover the handle. The
weaver is fastened off by bringing it inside the
basket across a spoke, in again, and then cut off.</p>

<p>The braided handle is made by using six pieces of
rattan braiding using two pieces in each strand.</p>

<p>While weaving the basket, three pieces are pushed
in on each side of a spoke and the weaving is continued
over the spokes.</p>

<p>The double ring handle is made by twisting rattan
into rings and sewing the rings to the weaving of the
basket on opposite sides.</p>

<p>In sewing baskets or other articles, different
kinds of stitches are used. To put a hat together
the braids are sewed together with a plain stitch,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
whereas in putting a basket together a fancy stitch
is employed.</p>

<p>The Indians are famous for the various kinds of
fancy stitches, which they have used in making
basketry articles.</p>

<p>The skip stitch which is used in sewed baskets is
made by enclosing two spokes at a time or enclosing
one spoke between every two.</p>

<p>Another useful and decorative stitch which is
often used is the split stitch. The spokes are
twined with raffia for a certain distance and then are
split in two and the right spoke of one is joined to
the left spoke of the other and twined with raffia as
one.</p>

<p>Sometimes in making a cover for a hanging jar
the spokes radiating from the centre are brought
diagonally across each other and joined together by
the winding stitch.</p>

<p>Many of the simple lace stitches described in a
preceding chapter prove very useful in basketry work.</p>

<p>To make the melon-shaped basket shown in
<a href="#Fig206">Figure 206</a> a six-inch pair of embroidery hoops will
be needed. One hoop is placed inside of the other.
The inside hoop is perpendicular while the other one
is horizontal. Tie the two rings together at the point
of intersection.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span></p>

<p>From basket splint one sixteenth of an inch thick,
cut six strips which are ten inches in length. They
should be one inch and three quarters in the centre
and taper to points at both ends.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<a name="Fig206"></a><img src="images/i_280.jpg" width="600" height="611" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 206. A melon-shaped basket </div>
</div>

<p>Select raffia in two shades.   The natural and
brown were used for this basket. With a strand of
the brown start to weave at the point of intersection.</p>

<p>Wind around the four pieces of hoop until a
square about one and a half inches is made. Repeat
on the opposite side of the hoops.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">

<div class="capr">Photograph by Mary G. Huntsman</div>
<div class="caption">Sewed Raffia Baskets Make Attractive Gifts</div>
</div>

<p>Take two of these pieces of prepared basket
splints and insert them in the centre of both squares.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
First one side of the pieces is inserted in the square
and then the other end of the ribs is inserted in
the other square. The natural colour raffia is now
used to weave over the hoops and ribs. The weaving
is done over and under and back and forth from side
to side until there are a dozen rows of weaving.
The other side of the basket is treated in like manner.</p>

<p>The other four ribs are inserted two on each side
of those previously placed. Now begin and weave
all the way across. Weave several rows of brown
then the natural raffia. You will put in more or
less of the brown raffia as you desire, only the
pattern on each side of the centre must agree.</p>

<p>Instead of weaving from one side and then across
to the other, it is a better plan to weave a little
first on one side of the basket and then on the other.
In this way you are sure of
your pattern.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 300px;">
<a name="Fig207"></a><img src="images/i_283.jpg" width="300" height="294" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 207. The cover</div>
</div>

<p>If the raffia is threaded in
a large needle it is easier to
weave.</p>

<p>Another strand or more is
wound around the handle. A
basket such as this makes an
attractive fruit basket and is just the thing to give
to sick friends or to use when going berrying.</p>

<div class="caption">Fig. 208. Buttonholing the cardboard </div>
</div>

<p>Raffia can be used in many ways as you have
already seen. A pretty box for jewellery is one that
is almost as easy to make as
the napkin ring. Get a
sheet of thin white cardboard.
The brown cardboard
is a very weak material and
easily bends and breaks.
Cut two circles of cardboard
five inches in diameter. Use
compasses to inscribe the circle,
so that it may be perfect.
Then cut a strip seventeen
inches long by two inches
wide. From the centre of
one of the circles cut a two-inch circle. This piece
will be the top of the
box. Now thread your
needle with a strand of
the raffia which has
been soaked in water
and buttonhole in raffia
over the cardboard.
When the cardboard
has been entirely covered with the raffia stitches
(<a href="#Fig207">Figure 207</a>) take the other circle of cardboard and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
cut a half-inch circle from the centre. Cover this
piece of cardboard like the top. (<a href="#Fig208">Figure 208</a>).
The raffia should be wiped before using it; if not
the water will spoil the cardboard.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 400px;">

<div class="caption">Fig. 209. A simple basket box</div>
</div>

<p>The centre opening on the cover will be filled with
a spider-in-its-web. Make four strands of raffia
across the space. We now have eight spokes.
Take the threaded needle back to the centre and
having passed under a spoke go back and pick it up.
The idea is to go back over one and forward under
two. Continue in this manner till the spider is the
size you desire.</p>

<p>The long strip of cardboard is sewed together and
is worked like the napkin ring. With a strand of
raffia, cast or bind the bottom of the box to the side.
The top is fastened on one side with two strands of
raffia which are tied in a bow. The extra ends are
cut off.</p>

<h2><a name="XXIII" id="XXIII"></a>XXIII<br /><br />
<small>RAFFIA HATS</small></h2>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Many</span> of our little girls have made any
number of dolls' hats by just braiding
raffia and sewing the braids together.</p>

<p>If you were to make a large hat (by this I mean
a hat large enough to wear yourself) by sewing braids
of raffia together, it would be entirely too heavy and
also would fall into any shape, perhaps not a very
desirable one.</p>

<p>The only thing to do would be to procure a wire
frame and to make the raffia hat on it.</p>

<p>In order to do this we will have to braid enough
raffia for the whole hat before doing anything else.</p>

<p>For this kind of braiding the raffia will have to
be soaked in water and then rolled out so that the
strands will look like pieces of ribbon about three
quarters of an inch wide.</p>

<p>You may use a five, seven, or nine strand braid
for this hat. Take one long strand of raffia and place
it horizontally on a flat surface. Tie seven long
pieces to the horizontal piece as shown in <a href="#Fig210">Figure 210</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span></p>

<p>Begin with the last strand on the right-hand side
and weave it over the next, under the following one,
etc., toward the left side letting it hang out to the
left. Take the next strand on the right and weave
it in the same manner as the preceding one.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<a name="Fig210"></a><img src="images/i_287.jpg" width="500" height="471" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 210. Weaving the raffia </div>
</div>

<p>When the left-hand side is reached, drop the first
left-hand one with the rest and let the new weaver
hang out till the next is brought over. The first one,
when it reaches the left side, is always turned over
the last weaver just brought over before dropping it
(the first one) into place with the others.</p>

<p>When the first set of strands are used, replace them
one at a time by using the new and old together about
two inches from the end of each.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span></p>

<p>It will take about eighteen or twenty yards of braiding
to cover the frame. When the braiding is ready
to sew on the hat, begin with the centre of the crown.
When the crown is entirely covered, start with the
brim and begin sewing the coils together to the
frame at the base of the crown. The under side
of the brim may be covered with silk or material
of a similar kind, or if you prefer to have it, covered
with braid sewed on in the same manner as the
outside, beginning at the base of the crown.</p>

<p>When the whole hat frame has been covered with
the braiding, you may roll it in the front or on the
side, or in fact any place to suit yourself. A nice
large bow of ribbon placed on the hat in a becoming
fashion would make it very attractive, or for those
who prefer flowers and ribbon the hat trimmed in
this manner would be equally charming.</p>

<p>A woven raffia hat made on a wire frame is a very
charming and neat creation.</p>

<p>It takes time and patience and skill to make the
hat, but when it is finished you are doubly repaid
for your work and the time spent on it.</p>

<p>The crown is woven first and then fitted to the
crown of the wire frame. Take a small strand of
raffia to make a ring of very small dimensions, say
about one quarter of an inch in diameter. To this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
ring, knot eight strands of raffia as shown in <a href="#Fig211">Figure
211</a>. Eight more strands are tied around each of
the eight strands, using the very pretty and effective
"Solomon's Knot."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<a name="Fig211"></a><img src="images/i_289.jpg" width="500" height="496" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 211. The crown of the hat</div>
</div>

<p>This knot is a very simple twist and may be tied
either with a double or single strand. The strand
which is tied on is laid first under the main double
strand and then both ends are crossed over each
other. The right one goes first under the end of the
left-hand one and over the double middle strand and
then again under the loop of the left-hand one.</p>

<p>It would be well to practise with strands of raffia
other than those used in making the hat so as to
become quite familiar with the knot before using it
on the hat. Counting the eight strands tied to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
ring and the sixty-four strands that are Solomon-knotted
to the original eight we have seventy-two
strands in all. They start from a common centre
and are brought down and outward through the
pattern and are knotted one by one onto the main
strands as they cross.</p>

<p>If you were to trace any one of the seventy-two
strands you will find that it comes to the outside
edge of the square through a very simple course.
The last or eighth strand, knotted to the main strands,
is used to tie up the bunch of strands coming from
the sides of the diamond. It falls into place with
the other strands and is tied up in turn as the
others are. The larger knot tying up the bunch of
raffia in the centre of the diamond is the same kind
of knot as the smaller ones. It may look slightly
different in composition, but that is due to the fact
that it is being tied around a larger bulk.</p>

<p>After the knots have been all tied at the edges of
the diamonds, the ends are woven under and over
making a sort of a square design as shown in the
illustration.</p>

<p>The finishing of the crown is done by taking four
strands, two from each of the squares at the centre,
and knotting them together with a simple knot.
Two from each side are knotted together.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span></p>

<p>If you find that the strands do not come out in
sets of four, make an extra strand by splitting in
two one of the other strands.</p>

<p>The brim of the hat is not so tedious to make as
the crown and having a larger surface on which to
work you will find that the progress is more rapid
and requires less time and energy.</p>

<p>Knot on the outer wire of the frame as many
strands of raffia as will fit very closely but easily
side by side and then tie them into loops such as
were used on the edge of the crown of the hat.
This loop is the same as that used in making the
shopping bags and hammocks described in the next
chapter.</p>

<p>You may use your own judgment in designing
the brim. The outer edge may be made of the same
loops that we have just spoken of. On the next
row the strands of raffia are drawn down tightly
and tied around the wire with a simple knot.</p>

<p>Alternate these two designs and you will have a
very pretty brim.</p>

<p>To finish off the edge on the brim, cut the ends off
to about three quarters of an inch in length and sew
them in under the wire with a needle threaded with
fine raffia. A tapestry needle or a darning needle
would do for this purpose.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span></p>

<p>The trimming for this hat could be easily made of
raffia. I will leave it to the maker to decide what
would be most suitable to the taste. I might
suggest such articles as buckles made of raffia
or rattan or perhaps quills made of raffia.</p>

<p>If you do not care to have the hat trimmed with
its own material, velvet ribbon, satin, flowers,
quills, etc., would make a desirable trimming.</p>

<p>A very bewitching hat of a plain, three-strand
braid of raffia can be easily made with very little
trouble.</p>

<p>The raffia has to be soaked in water until it is
soft. Unroll each strip and it will probably be
about three quarters of an inch wide. In order to
make the braid thick enough it will be necessary to
use three or four pieces in one strand of the braid.
Braid about nineteen or twenty yards before beginning
to make the hat.</p>

<p>Choose a wire frame of a low rounded crown and
a broad flat brim. If you wish to change the shape
of the frame after the braid is sewed on, it will be a
very trifling matter.</p>

<p>The end at which the braid is begun forms the
centre of the crown. It is bent over at about five
eighths of an inch from the tip and the long end is
coiled around in a second row, the edge of which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
comes an eighth of an inch under the edge of the
centre. It is generally sewed on with a darning
needle, threaded with a very fine strand of raffia.
Use the back-stitch bringing the strand all the way
through on the right side and then all the way
through underneath.</p>

<p>The crown is made entirely by sewing the plaits
together, separately from the wire frame, but it
will be well to try it on the frame occasionally so that
it will securely fit. When about six or seven rows
have been sewed together and the crown is four or
five inches high, the brim is begun. The coil of
braiding is brought around more loosely and flattened
out as it is sewed.</p>

<p>When six or seven rows have been completed, the
brim at the back will be large enough. Each succeeding
row will have to be cut as it gets near the
back and the end fitted in under the previous row
until the sides near the back are about nine or ten
rows wide and the front twelve rows. It would be
well to pull the coil slightly tighter as it draws nearer
the outer edge so that the last rows may roll a little.</p>

<p>If you care to have the under brim of braided raffia
it can be made in the same way, except that it is one
row wider at the front and sides, to allow it to roll
over the edges of the brim. It is pressed on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
wrong side and attached to the under brim of the
wire frame, with very small stitches of raffia. The
outer edge of the under brim should not be fastened
until the crown and the top brim are on the wire
frame, as the top brim should come over the edge of
the under brim.</p>

<p>The crown and the upper brim are now pressed
on the inside and put on the frame to which they are
caught with a stitch of raffia here and there.</p>

<p>The centre of the crown particularly should be
firmly attached with stitching to the centre of the
wire frame. A row of braiding is brought around
to cover where the upper and under brims join inside
the rolled brim and is sewed on either edge with small
stitches of raffia.</p>

<div class="caption">Fig. 212. A braided hat for yourself </div>
</div>

<p>A hat like this would
be very pretty trimmed
with a satin ribbon
or silk bow. A
large bow at the side or
the back would make it
very attractive if the bow is of a contrasting colour.</p>

<p>Some people prefer leaves and flowers, with a
little touch of silk; others quills or feathery materials.
In fact it may be trimmed with material of any kind.</p>

<small>KNOTTING FOR DOLLS' HAMMOCKS, SHOPPING BAGS,
AND OTHER PURPOSES</small></h2>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Knotting</span> of raffia for dolls' hammocks,
shopping bags, belts, coverings for hanging
jars, and many other things proves to
be a very interesting part of the basketry work.</p>

<p>Little girls could easily make some very pretty
belts to be worn with some of their dainty frocks,
and I don't know what could be more delightful
than a hammock for dolly to sleep in.</p>

<p>First let us see how we can make dolly's hammock.
We will have to have two small brass rings about
three quarters of an inch in diameter, twelve pieces
of raffia, and a pair of scissors.</p>

<p>Place one of the rings on a table or other flat
surface and tie each of the twelve pieces of raffia
on the ring, leaving an end about an inch long.
Begin and tie simple knots three inches from the
ring and one inch apart, knotting the strands two
and two until nine or ten rows have been completed.
Finish the hammock by fastening the ends three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
inches from the last row of knots, to the other ring.
The hammock is ready for Sally Ann to have a nap.</p>

<p>The next thing to do is to make a shopping bag,
to carry all the small bundles when you go down
town to buy dolls' clothes.</p>

<p>This little bag is made with the same kind of
knotting, only the number of strands and the arrangement
of them differ (<a href="#Fig213">Figure 213</a>).</p>

<p>Twenty-two strands of raffia and a pair of scissors
are necessary. Arrange twenty of the strands in
pairs, and tie each pair in the centre. Place them
on a table with the knots side by side, leaving a
little less than ten inches on each side of the knots.
Begin on one side of the centre knots, and tie one
strand from one knot to the next strand from the
next knot. They must be an inch from the first knots.
Tie the same two strands an inch from the centre
on the opposite side. In the same way tie the outside
strands of this group to form the corners. Tie
them one inch from the first centre knot. Make
ten rows of knots an inch apart. When these have
been completed, the bag is ready for the handles.</p>

<p>Separate the strands on one side of the bag from
those on the other. Divide the group on one side
in half. Fasten each group one and a half inches
beyond the last row of knots. Braid the strands<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
about six inches. Do the same with each group,
making four braids in all. Hold the two braids
from one end of the bag together so that the loose
ends of one braid overlap
the other. Beginning
at the middle point
make a binding one
and a half inches to
the right and a similar
one to the left. Cover
the binding with "Solomon's
Knots." Keep
the lines of knotting
straight. Finish the
opposite handle in the
same way.</p>

<div class="caption">Fig. 213. A shopping bag </div>
</div>

<p>Some day when you
have shopping to do
for your mother, take
your bag along and see how handy it will be.</p>

<p>In the beginning of the chapter I spoke of a belt
to wear with a pretty frock. A belt made of a six
strand braid proves to be very serviceable to some
little girls. You may use plain white raffia or a
plain colour but oftentimes two colours add to the
attractiveness of the belt.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span></p>

<p>Take three long pieces of raffia, that is, if the raffia
is very thick; if not, six or twelve pieces using two
or four pieces as one strand. Hold the strands at
the centre in the left hand. Put the strand on the
extreme right over and under the next two strands.
The strand on the extreme left is put under, over
and under the other strands. This forms a braid.
Continue doing this braiding until the belt is long
enough to suit you. To finish the ends tie the
remaining loose strands close to the braid and cut off
the ends. Turn the knots under and sew over the ends
with the loop-stitch described in a preceding chapter.</p>

<p>In working with raffia many times an article
will need something to put a finishing touch to it,
I would suggest using a fringe or tassel according
to the kind of work in question. In my experience
they have proved to be just the thing for such purposes.
For example, in knotting raffia for a work bag,
the ends of the raffia may be left hanging and when
cut to an even length provide a very plain finish for
the bottom of the bag. Fringing or tassels would,
I think, add considerably to the appearance of the
article. To make fringe on the bottom of such a
bag it is necessary to cut the ends an even length
after the last knot has been made, and with a pin
or needle fray out the ends very finely.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span></p>

<p>The way to make tassels for a finish is to wind a
strand of raffia over a cardboard about two or three
times, or if the tassel is to be quite thick, wind five
or six times. Slip it off and bind it several times
near the top with the end strand of the bag. Sew it
fast with a tapestry needle.
Cut through the centre of
the loops. A row of these
across the bottom of a bag
are very effective.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 300px;">
<a name="Fig214"></a><img src="images/i_299.jpg" width="300" height="508" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 214. A whisk broom </div>
</div>

<p>A very dainty little article
for a very small child to
make is a little clothes brush
or whisk broom. Secure a
brass ring about one inch in
diameter and cover the
ring with the loop stitch.
Fold twelve strands of raffia
twice and slip the bunch
through the ring bending it in the middle.
Make a binding one inch below the ring and one
inch long; cover the binding with "Solomon's
Knots." Fringe the ends well and trim off evenly
(<a href="#Fig214">Figure 214</a>).</p>

<p>Knotting in silks, cotton or linen strands should
be mentioned in this chapter. It is a difficult thing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
to find a piece of fringe that will just match the
colour of silk you have but it is an easy matter to
make the fringe yourself. The simplest kind is the
knot fringe. It can be made of filo, rope, twisted,
or heavy floss when used in connection with a silk,
satin, or velvet background. For cotton or linen
background, cotton floss or fine cord can be
used.</p>

<p>Let us suppose that you wish to make the fringe
into a hem. Take a cluster of six or eight strands
of rope silk, ten inches in length, and draw them
through the extreme edge of the hem. If the other
kind of silks are used, more strands will be necessary.
Knot the cluster close to the hem. At a little less
than a half inch distance over make another cluster
and repeat in this manner across the space on which
you want the fringe.</p>

<p>Now take the first cluster and divide it in half.
Hold the half nearest the next group in your left
hand and divide the second group. Taking the
half close to first group, knot the strands together
one half inch from the hem. Continue like this
all the way across. Do not pucker the material
when knotting.</p>

<p>A third row of knots is now made below the second.
This takes up the first half of the knot previously<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
used and half of the next group. In this way you
form a diamond. If a deeper fringe with more knots
is desired cut the strands of silk three inches longer.
For every inch of fringe allow three inches of
strands.</p>

<h2><a name="XXV" id="XXV"></a>XXV<br /><br />
<small>SIMPLE BEAD CHAINS ON SINGLE STRINGS, A
HOME-MADE LOOM, WOVEN CHAINS,
BELTS AND PURSES</small></h2>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Have</span> you ever taken pop corn and made a
chain of it for Christmas trees, or perhaps
you have strung cranberries? Maybe it
was the first time that you ever held a needle. I
remember when we were youngsters living in the
South, our nurse used to take us out under trees and
we would string "Job's Tears" for hours. Many
drug stores sell these seeds on strings for infants
to cut their teeth on.</p>

<p>The simplest form of bead work is just as easy as
stringing pop corn or berries. Beads come in all
sizes from the tiny ones that are no bigger than a
top of a pin to the large ones the size of a marble.
Sometimes you can get odd-shaped beads, flat on
one side and curved on the other. A string that is
pretty enough to wear on state occasions can be
made of heart-shaped and round beads.</p>

<p>The regular bead needle is very fine and long.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
It is better when stringing a single strand to double
the thread. Use linen thread No. 100 or 150. Thread
the needle with a piece of thread eight inches longer
than double the length of the necklace. Bring the
two ends together and make a knot three and a
half inches from the ends of the thread. The
thread will be very much stronger if you wax it.
Now thread seven small round beads then an odd
shaped one. Repeat in this manner till you have
the length of chain desired. Cut off the needle and
tie the remaining thread in a tight knot close to the
beads. Ribbons are sometimes used to fasten the
chain or necklace together but the little clasps that
you can buy for a few cents are neater and do not
get soiled as ribbon does. Fasten on the clasp with
the thread that extends beyond the knots.</p>

<p>A sweet little daisy chain can be made on two
threads. Thread two bead needles with two long
threads. Bring one end of each thread together and
make a knot as described above. Fasten the knot to
a table with a pin so that one needle is on the right
and the other one on the left. Thread two white
beads on your right hand needle. Put your left
hand needle down through the white bead so that
you have a thread coming from each side of the
beads.   Your needles will have changed position.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
Thread the right hand needle with one yellow bead.
Pass the left hand needle down through this and
again the needles are reversed. Thread two more
white beads like the first two and do the same thing.
Now take the right hand needle and thread two
more white beads and carry the needle through the
first two white beads from right to left. Thread
two more white beads on the same needle and carry
it through the second or top group of white beads
from left to right. Thread ten green beads on each
of the needles and now we are ready to make another
daisy (<a href="#Fig215">Figure 215</a>). Continue in this manner till
the necklace is complete.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<a name="Fig215"></a><img src="images/i_304.jpg" width="600" height="72" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 215. A daisy chain </div>
</div>

<p>Another and more elaborate daisy chain is made
on one needle. Make a knot in the thread and
string four green beads. Hold this down between
the thumb and forefinger of the left hand. Thread
one green bead and pass through the third of the
four beads. Thread another green bead and pass
through the first bead. Thread one white bead and
pass through the green one on the left. Thread
another green bead and pass through the green one
to the left (<a href="#Fig216">Figure 216</a>).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span></p>

<p>Third row&mdash;Thread a green, pass into a green to
the left. Now thread a white bead and pass in
through the first white bead.</p>

<div class="caption">Fig. 216. A woven daisy chain </div>
</div>

<p>Fourth row&mdash;Thread a yellow bead and pass
through last white,
and a green bead
through the green.</p>

<p>Fifth row&mdash;A green
bead through the last
green, a white through
the yellow.</p>

<p>Sixth row&mdash;A white
bead through the last white, a green through the
last green.</p>

<p>Seventh row&mdash;A white through the last green,
a green through the last white of the sixth row.</p>

<p>Then three white beads on the needle and pass
through the first white on the second row. Carry
the thread through the daisy thus formed till you
have it again in same position as it was before you
threaded the three beads.</p>

<p>Eighth row&mdash;One green into the last green, one
white into the last white. (Note that you are now
starting another daisy on the left-hand side).</p>

<p>Ninth row&mdash;One yellow into last white, one green
into last green.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span></p>

<p>Tenth row&mdash;One green into last green, one white
into yellow.</p>

<p>Eleventh row&mdash;One white into last white, one
green into green.</p>

<p>Twelfth row&mdash;One white into last green, one
green into white.</p>

<p>Repeat the directions from the second row.
Note that though the chain is four beads wide there
are only two beads that you work on in each row.</p>

<p>If the thread breaks, start the new one, two or
three rows back and go through the different beads.</p>

<p>The above directions are for a chain that is worked
without a loom. Now-a-days it is quite possible
to buy a little loom for about fifty cents, but you
can make one at home that will not cost you a penny.
The size of the loom will depend on what you are
working but we presume that it is a chain. Should
you ever make a purse it would pay you to buy
a loom.</p>

<p>To make the home-made loom get a piece of card
and a wooden meat skewer such as butchers use.
Fasten the skewer down on both ends to the cardboard
about two inches from the upper edge. One
inch above the skewer in the direct centre make a hole
and one inch from the bottom edge of the cardboard
make another hole. Cut six pieces of No. 90 linen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
thread, thirty-six inches long. This measurement
is sufficient for a chain twenty-seven inches or under.
Tie one end of each thread to the skewer. Now
holding the six threads together, carry them down
through the bottom hole across the back of the cardboard
and tie in a loose knot to the top hole.</p>

<p>Thread a bead needle with a thread of No. 100<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
linen thread that has been well waxed. Tie the
thread to the extreme right hand thread of the warp.
Now we are ready to make the chain (<a href="#Fig217">Figure 217</a>).</p>

<p>First row&mdash;Thread the needle with five yellow
beads. Pass the needle toward the left under the
warp threads, letting one bead slip in every space.
On the left hand side bring the needle up to the right
side and slip it through the five beads.</p>

<p>Before I tell you how to make any more bead
chains and the other articles that may be made
with beads, I want to tell you how to make a dainty
purse that is illustrated in this chapter. It is made
of gold and rose-coloured glass beads and it belongs
to a bright little girl I know who has been using it
for the past three years. A spool of heavy buttonhole
twist of a colour to correspond to one of the
coloured beads is needed (<a href="#Fig221">Figure 221</a>).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span></p>

<p>Take eighteen strands of silk, each a yard long.
See that the ends are all even. Tie a tight knot
through the centre of the threads. Thread a bead
needle with one of the strands of silk. Put on two
pink beads then three yellow, five pink,
three yellow, five pink, three yellow,
five pink, three yellow, five pink, five
yellow, one pink, seven yellow, one
pink, seven yellow, one pink, seven
yellow, one pink, five yellow, five pink,
three yellow, five pink, three yellow,
five pink, three yellow, five pink, three
yellow, seven pink. This completes
the first string. Do not allow any
beads to drop, which they are very apt
to do while you are working on another
row. It is suggested that the strand
of silk on the left of the beads should
be knotted closely to the beads to
prevent them from slipping.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 136px;">
<a name="Fig221"></a><img src="images/i_312.jpg" width="136" height="600" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 221. The
bead bag described </div>
</div>

<p>Unthread your needle and take the
next strand; thread two pink, one yellow,
then slip your needle through the second yellow
bead of the first row, thread one yellow, five
pink, one yellow, now slip your needle through the
middle yellow bead of the first row or in other words<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
slip your needle through every eighth bead on the
first row. The colouring remains the same.
I will start the instructions again for the second
row which is to be threaded, two pink, one yellow,
slip needle through bead on first row, one yellow,
five pink, one yellow, slip needle through bead,
one yellow, five pink, one yellow, slip needle
through, one yellow, five pink, one yellow, slip
needle through bead, one yellow, five pink, one yellow,

yellow, slip needle, one yellow, six pink, slip needle
into last bead of first row and knot the two threads
close to the bead. Be sure that the knot is large
enough not to slip through the hole of the bead.</p>

<p>Thread your needle with the third strand. Put
on two pink, three yellow, two pink, slip needle
through third bead of first group of five pink of
the second row. (For the rest of the row "slip
needle" means slip the needle through the fourth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
bead below the one slipped through on the second
row) two pink, three yellow, two pink, slip needle,
two pink, three yellow, two pink, slip needle, two
pink, three yellow, two pink, slip needle, two pink,
five yellow, slip needle, seven yellow, slip needle,
seven yellow, slip needle, seven yellow, slip needle,
five yellow, two pink, slip needle, two pink, three
yellow, two pink, slip needle, two pink, three yellow,
two pink, slip needle, two pink, three yellow, two
pink, slip needle, four pink.</p>

<p>The fourth row is the same as the second. Every
other row from the third is also worked like the third.</p>

<p>The last row which joins the bag&mdash;Two pink,
slip needle into fourth bead of next to last row,
thread three more beads, slip into centre bead of the
group of sevens of the first row. The pattern is
diamond-shaped as you will note, therefore after
threading your needle with three beads of the shade
to correspond with the previous row slip your needle
in the centre bead of the groups of seven of the preceding
row and the first row. Work first to the right
and then to the left.</p>

<p>Every two strands of silk must be knotted together
to keep the beads from slipping off. Braid
the threads extending beyond the bead work in
groups of three.   A large bead or slide will be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
necessary to make the purse a practical money bag.
Get two big beads that have openings large
enough to pass all the silk threads through. Take
a knot on the silk thread after the first large bead
is in position. This knot should be two inches at
least from the beads. The silk threads may now
be cut quite close to the knot or they may be cut
one inch from the knot to form a tassel.</p>

<p>If the little purse was left without any further work
it would look quite top heavy and unfinished, for
that reason a bead tassel is suggested as shown in
the illustration of the bead purse.</p>

<p>Thread your needle with a long strand of the buttonhole
twist. String about two and a half inches
of pink beads. Before commencing to string the
beads fasten the thread in the heavy knot at the
bottom of the purse. Catch the thread with the
beads also in the knot. Make two pink strings
this length and two yellow. Then make four
strings, two pink and two yellow, that are not more
than an inch and a half long. Fasten off the threads
securely and the bag is complete.</p>

<p>Three bunches of pink beads and two bunches of
yellow will make two purses as have just been
described. The beads vary in price from six cents a
bunch to twenty-five cents. Sometimes the more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
expensive kind have only half the number of beads
that the cheaper bunches have. Do not get too
small a bead or the work will become very tedious.
The large beads for the slides are more expensive.
They cost four cents apiece or more.</p>

<p>Of course other colour combinations can be made,
also other patterns. Silver and blue is another
pretty combination for a bead purse.</p>

<p>Now while we are on the topic of beads, I would
like to tell you about some sensible porti&egrave;res and
cushion tops that I recently saw at an Arts and
Crafts exhibition made of an inexpensive background
and beads. Monk's cloth was used for
one of the porti&egrave;res. Monk's cloth is somewhat
like burlap but the weave is coarser and more even.
A hem was turned on one short side and one of the
long sides and the thread drawn out for a space
of about two inches. The threads were hemstitched
and then a design of beads worked between the groups
of threads. To accomplish this the design was well
planned out before commencing the work. The
number of beads needed to fill out the space can be
judged by placing the beads in the opening and
testing that for yourself. After the design has
been selected make a pencil copy of it. It is better
to restrict yourself at first to just two colours.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
Fasten your sewing thread securely to the threads
of the material. Use carpet thread for the weaving.
Let us suppose that you have selected a pattern
that is seven rows of beads deep and you have chosen
tan as the background and red and chalk white
beads for the decoration:</p>

<p>First row&mdash;Thread one red bead, six white, one
red, six white. As we will only work a section at
a time, let us secure the beads. Slip your thread
under the hemstitching. Now let each bead come
between two consecutive groups of hemstitching.
Bring your thread to the right side. Be careful
not to disturb your beads. Now carry the thread
through the beads again. The thread should be
drawn tight but not so as to pucker the hem.</p>

<p>Second row&mdash;Work this by stringing one white,
one red, four white, one red, one white, one red,
four white, one red. Fasten as described in the
first row.</p>

<p>Third row&mdash;One red, one white, four red, one
white, one red, one white, four red, one white.
Fasten.</p>

<p>Fourth row&mdash;One red, one white, one red, four
white, one red, one white, one red, four white.
Fasten.</p>

<p>Fifth row&mdash;One red, one white, four red, one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
white, one red, one white, four red, one white.
Fasten.</p>

<p>Sixth row&mdash;One white, one red, four white, one
red, one white, one red, four white, one red. Fasten.</p>

<p>Seventh and final row&mdash;One red, six white, one
red, six white. Fasten.</p>

<p>After this section is worked slip your needle
through the beads to the last one on the first row
and continue to weave.</p>

<p>The beads to use for porti&egrave;res or large pillows
are round ones that are three eighths of an inch
in diameter.</p>

<p>For curtains, table covers or any article where the
weight of the large bead is not desirable use a smaller
bead that is not more than a quarter-inch in size.</p>

<p>Scrim curtains with a single row of the smaller
beads add a pretty touch of colour to the otherwise
plain window. Almost any shade can be had in
the beads, but the trouble is that they can not be
bought at every store. A bead supply house is the
one from which to get them. They cost only one-quarter
as much as when bought in a department store.</p>

<p>Ecru scrim with a row of turquoise blue, canary
yellow and sage green beads and the simple
twist stitch such as described in the chapter on
"Simple Stitches in Drawn Work," makes a curtain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
suitable for a simple room. The way to accomplish
this work, is to take a stitch on the drawn thread,
in the regular way for the twist stitch, then slip a
bead on, then take another stitch, then a bead, so
on to the end.</p>

<p>If a skeleton square of beads is desired on a sofa
cushion it is advisable not to draw it out in the same
manner as for a curtain.</p>

<p>For a two-inch border to be set in four inches from
the edge, crease the cushion through the direct
centre. Measure four inches from the edge and
cut the material on the crease for two inches.
Treat each side like this. Draw the threads out
on each side of the cut, stop when you get four
inches from the edge. Of course the material must
be in a perfect square and just the size you want for
the pillow before you begin any of the work. Place
the beads as explained for the porti&egrave;re. Do not cut
the threads you drew out but, threading a needle
with two or three at a time, carry them through the
beads. In this way there is no necessity for cutting
and buttonholing the corners where the border
intersects, as in drawn work. Loose woven materials
such as monk's or arris cloth are extremely hard to
buttonhole and even after very careful work they
are apt to fray.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span></p>

<p>If a fancy edge is desired for the pillow one made
of beads is far more appropriate than anything
else. After the pillow is complete and made up,
put on the bead edge by catching a bead to the
material at a short distance from each other.</p>

<p>For a canoe or porch pillow there is nothing more
durable than bead pillows of a dark colour worked

<small>BRAIDING AND WEAVING FOUR AND SIX STRANDS<br />
WEAVING ON LOOMS</small></h2>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Braiding</span> or plaiting can be done in any
materials and may be used for shopping
bags or circular rugs.   Raffia, corset laces,
heavy silk floss or rags can be utilized for the braiding.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 400px;">
<a name="Fig222"></a><img src="images/i_321.jpg" width="400" height="218" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 222. The strands crossed </div>
</div>

<p>It is extremely difficult to conceal the ends when
three strands are used so for that reason I have
selected four strands to commence with.</p>

<p>When working with cords or very long strands
of material, knot the
four ends together. Pin
the knot to your knee
and proceed to weave.
Take the extreme left-hand
strand and weave
under the next strand. At the same time weave
the extreme right-hand strand over the next.
Cross the two strands in the centre. (See <a href="#Fig222">Figure
222</a>.) If a knot is not desired at the start the
cords may be commenced as shown in the <a href="#Fig223">Figure 223</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span></p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 200px;">
<a name="Fig223"></a><img src="images/i_322.jpg" width="200" height="467" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 223. The way
to commence braiding
without a knot</div>
</div>

<p>To braid with six strands take the extreme left-hand
strand and weave under and over to centre
and with the right-hand strand weave over and
under to centre and cross the left-hand strand (see
<a href="#Fig224">Figure 224</a>).</p>

<p>After the braid has been made it can be sewed
together for a mat. In joining a
strand insert the new piece so
that it extends a little beyond the
braid. If a long braid is desired it
is best to have the strands of different
lengths so that the joinings will
not be all in one place (<a href="#Fig225">Figure 225</a>).</p>

<p>When braiding or weaving with
rags cut the strips about three
quarters of an inch wide. Old rags
can be used for this, cutting out
the weak parts. Cheap cotton fabrics
when new make excellent mats.</p>

<p>Weaving on frames is very interesting and not
such a difficult task as you imagine. There are hand
and treadle looms. The following instructions will
be for the former. A stretcher such as artists use
for painting can be used or four pieces of board
twenty-four inches long by four inches wide and one
inch thick. Take the four pieces to form a frame.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 405px;">

<div class="caption">A Cushion Top Can be Woven on a Simple Hand Loom</div>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span></p>

<p>Buy three half-inch dowels or long round sticks;
which may be bought from a hardware shop; and
sand-paper till they are quite smooth. Screw in
four large picture rings two on
each side of the frame, one at
each end. Slip one dowel
through the rings at each end
and tie to picture ring.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 250px;">
<a name="Fig224"></a><img src="images/i_325.jpg" width="250" height="543" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 224.   Braiding with six
strands </div>
</div>

<p>The warp may be cord which
is sold by the pound or a
heavy soft twine. A wholesale
cord or rope house will
be the best from which to buy
the warp.</p>

<p>A thin board such as you
have in your window shades
and to which the string is
attached   makes a   good
shuttle.   Cut it so that it is twenty-two inches
long and wind the warp on it lengthwise.</p>

<p>Tie one end of the warp thread to the lower left-hand
picture ring.</p>

<p>Lay the warp threads over the lower dowel, up
through the frame and over the upper dowel. Remember
always to lay the thread outside and over
each dowel.   The first six threads are placed very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
close to each other. After that the threads are
laid half an inch or a little more than a quarter of
an inch apart. The finer the weaving the more
warp threads will be needed.
The usual allowance is from four
to eight threads to an inch.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 250px;">
<a name="Fig225"></a><img src="images/i_326.jpg" width="250" height="580" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 225. The way to
join a braid </div>
</div>

<p>Two plain boards that are as
long as the dowels and three
inches wide by a quarter of an
inch deep will be required now.
Slip into one of these boards at
each end between the warp
threads and bring the boards
to the centre and tie together
to keep them from slipping.</p>

<p>Take a piece of cord nine
inches longer than a dowel and
tie to the throat of the lower
left-hand screw. Make a knot
at first warp string and slip it over dowel. Twist
the double thread two, three or four times. Repeat
slipping over dowel and twisting between
every two warp strings until you reach the right hand
screw. Tie the threads to the screw. This is called
pairing the threads. Repeat the pairing at the
other dowel. When the pairing is finished slip the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
lower dowel out of the rings and tie the dowel again
to the screws.</p>

<p>To space the warp threads an upholsterer's needle
and carpet thread will be needed.</p>

<p>If the weaving occupies the full size of the frame,
hitch or tie the carpet thread to the lower left-hand
screw, while if the warp threads do not extend very
far over place an extra screw on the outside of the
frame where the warp threads begin.</p>

<p>Buttonhole stitch over the dowel keeping the
lower thread down and the upper thread on top.</p>

<p>Hold the warp threads apart with finger of the
left hand while buttonholing. Pull your stitches
tight. Two or three stitches should be made between
each two warp threads. The stitches must be
an eighth of an inch apart.</p>

<p>Now we are ready for the bridge.</p>

<p>Two feet, as they are called, will be necessary to
support the bridge. A carpenter will make them
for a small amount. They should be seven inches
high by three inches wide at the base (<a href="#Fig226">Figure 226</a>).
One foot is placed in the centre of opposite sides of
the frame and the third dowel run through the holes.</p>

<p>Loosen the two boards at the centre and place
them close to the dowel. Place the bridge over the
set of threads nearest you. Take a six-inch piece<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
of cord and catch up first warp thread. Tie thread
to bridge. All knots should be made like a weaver's
knot. The loop should not extend lower than two
inches below the bridge.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 200px;">
<a name="Fig226"></a><img src="images/i_328.jpg" width="200" height="367" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 226. The foot </div>
</div>

<p>This completes the setting up of the loom. To
weave, the material may be cut as
stated before or raffia or Indian fibre
may be used. If the weaving is to
be in one colour only, it is well
to join the pieces together and
wind on a long shuttle. If short
pieces are used a hook will be required.
It can be made of a strip
of wood taken from the hem of window
shades. Notch one end of it.</p>

<p>A selvage will be necessary at the beginning and
the end of the weaving and is done in a fine cord.</p>

<p>Start at left-hand corner and tie the thread to
warp. Pass the shuttle to right-hand side between
the threads. Lower the bridge and pass the shuttle
back again between the threads to left-hand side.
Raise the bridge again and repeat as just explained.
It will be best to comb down the woof to keep it
straight and regular. A regular weavers' comb can
be bought, but a coarse hair comb may be substituted.
Six rows will be sufficient for the selvage. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
regular weaving is worked the same only in coarse
warp. Remember the bridge must be lowered every
other time.</p>

<p>In weaving a new thread or strand commence a
little way back from where the last strand stopped.</p>

<p>Learn to weave and you get much more artistic
effects in rugs than ordinary rug or porti&egrave;re weavers
obtain.</p>

<p>Beautiful cushions and other useful articles can
be made by weaving.</p>

<p>It is a great mistake to think that all cast off
clothing can be woven into handsome rugs or
porti&egrave;res. True it is possible to weave them, but
it is almost a hopeless task to get artistic effects
from old coats or a lot of dark articles.</p>

<p>The modern rug weavers get a few yards of cheap
muslin in two or three shades and make a rug
that can be sold for two or three dollars. Silk is
not like old woollen materials, it can be utilized to
the last thread because it is soft and works to good
advantage.</p>

<p>Two old silk petticoats will make two pillow tops
that are artistic as well as useful. One of the most
beautiful examples of silk weaving was a cushion
I saw made from two old silk petticoats; one was sage
green and the other Delft blue. The strips were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
about one inch wide. All the worn parts were cut
out. No piece was considered too small to use.</p>

<p>Every pattern of rug has a name given it by the
weaver. The most common pattern is the hit-and-miss.
The name aptly describes it. There are
never two hit-and-miss patterns that are exactly
alike. To look at a collection of hit-and-miss rugs
one is reminded of the Croton shrub which has no
two leaves alike. As children, we used to call them
Match-me-if-you-can trees.</p>

<p>A hit-and-miss pattern is a good one to learn on.</p>

<p>Do not weave first one green strip then one blue
and so on, because you will get a jumble of blue
that is neither interesting nor pleasing. Decide on
which colour you would like for the background,
then use most of that shade.</p>

<p>I have heard an old weaver say that when she
works the hit-and-miss pattern she will carry first
one stripe of the background the entire way across
and probably start the second row. A little strip of
the second colour is then used and then the background
again. The good worker never cuts her
strips all the same length but strives to get the
effect of little slashes of colour against a solid background.
A rug made of medium blue and white
rags suggests the sea with white caps on it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span></p>

<p>When an Indian weaves a rug, he sits on the
floor and weaves, till he has to stand to work.</p>

<p>Tapestry is woven almost the same as described
for rugs; instead of the loom having a bridge that
has to be moved by hand to regulate the threads,
a treadle is used.</p>

<p>The wrong side of weaving is always facing you
on the loom and all ends are fastened afterward with a
needle and thread. Perhaps you would be interested
to know how a weaver makes a set design in tapestry.
Usually an artist designs a piece, say a design for the
back of a chair. Often the artist is the weaver himself.
He will make two sketches in colour one to put under
the warp threads and the other to keep in sight. He
then starts to weave the design in as many colours as
desired, then the background is worked.</p>

<p>A piece of hand-made tapestry is a possession that
only the very wealthy can buy for it is indeed exceptional
to find an ordinary weaver who can make
tapestry. To the French is given the honour of
being the most clever weavers in the world. As
a general thing in France weaving is an inherited
trade. You will find, if you ask the weaver what
his mother, his father and his grandfathers were,
he will tell you&mdash;weavers. The hands of the men
are almost as small and soft as the women's.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span></p>

<p>I have seen a beautiful screen that represented a
pansy field, if you can imagine such a thing worked
in over two hundred shades of silk. Every conceivable
kind of pansy was worked in it. It was
made for a man who loved pansies. It took four
weavers three months in which to make it, working
eight hours each day.</p>

<p>Too much thought can not be given to the right
colour for your rugs or whatever you intend to weave
on your simple loom. Study to get harmonizing
effects rather than contrasting ones. Gray is probably
the most pleasing of backgrounds and can be
combined to advantage with almost any other
shade. Remember that a dark room needs a cheerful
colouring while a bright airy room can stand
subdued shades.</p>

<p>Red excites the nerves. Lavender is depressing.
Blue is a cold colour and should be combined with
other colours to be effective. Green is restful to
the eyes in any shade, while yellow seems to reflect
light and for that reason is to be highly recommended
for use in a dark room. One of the prettiest rooms
I know, which is ordinarily a very dark one, is one
that has bright yellow and chestnut brown for its
decoration. The minute you enter that room you
are impressed with its cheerfulness and warmth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span></p>

<p>No matter how pretty and beautiful are the hangings
and other dainty touches of a room, a rug remains
the chief attraction. It is to a room what a vase is
to a flower. A rug is not absolutely necessary, but
unless it is the right kind your room looks patchy.</p>

<p>As in everything else practice makes perfect and
as soon as you become accustomed to weaving you
will plan regular designs that will make the work
more fascinating. If you have a large quantity
of undefinable shades of silk or wool or cotton rags
I would recommend that you dye them all one shade.</p>

<p>One ten-cent package of a dye will colour a couple
of pounds of rags. Get a dye that is good for all
three kinds of material as sometimes a dye that
changes the colour of silk may not affect cotton at all.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">The</span> beginner in crochet will have very little
trouble in learning the work as the stitches
used are comparatively few in number
although the various combinations in which they may
be used are almost unlimited. It is wise to become
accustomed to the stitches and especially with the
abbreviations, which are used so extensively throughout
all crochet work. No doubt the beauty and
variety of the patterns one can execute, also the
durability of the work are the chief causes for its
popularity at the present time.</p>

<p>The implement used is a crochet hook which
varies in size according with the quality of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
thread used. The steel hook with the bone handle
is to be preferred.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<a name="Fig227"></a><img src="images/i_335.jpg" width="600" height="275" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 227. Chain stitch </div>
</div>

<p>Too much emphasis cannot be placed upon the importance
of the position of the hands when working,
and the firmness of the stitches, as the work is,
at once, better and more even when the proper
position is maintained. The crochet needle should
be held lightly between the first finger and the thumb
of the right hand; the hook horizontal and parallel
with the first finger of the right hand, that part of
the work which is in course of construction being
held closely between the thumb and third finger of
the left hand. The thread is wound once around the
first finger, passes under the second and third fingers
of the left hand, and is wound around the small
finger. It is now held in position by bending the
fourth and small fingers toward the palm of the
hand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span></p>

<p>The foundation stitch of all crocheting is the chain
stitch (ch) (see <a href="#Fig227">Figure 227</a>) which is begun by making
a slip knot around the needle. Draw the thread
through this loop, and you have a chain. Again
draw the thread through this second loop, continue
until the chain is of desired length.</p>

<p>Another stitch is the slip stitch (sl st). Insert
the hook in the foundation work. Draw loop
through the work and another through the loop on
the needle.</p>

<p>Single crochet (s c). See <a href="#Fig228">Figure 228</a>.</p>

<div class="caption">Fig. 228. Single crochet </div>
</div>

<p>Insert hook in work, make a loop on the hook and
draw through, making two loops on the needle.
Throw thread again over hook. Draw thread
through both loops.</p>

<p>Double crochet (d c). See <a href="#Fig229">Figure 229</a>.</p>

<p>Before inserting the hook in the stitch to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
worked, put the thread around it. Throw thread
around hook and draw the thread through the
stitch and you will have three loops on hook. Throw
thread again around hook and draw thread through
two loops. Throw thread again around hook and
draw through the remaining two loops.</p>

<p>Put the thread around the hook twice, insert
in the work. Draw a loop through work, making
four loops upon needle. Draw the thread or loop
through two loops on needle, then again through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
two loops and the third time through the remaining
two loops.</p>

<h2><a name="XXVIII" id="XXVIII"></a>XXVIII<br /><br />
<small>PATTERN DIRECTIONS FOR MAKING DOLL CAPS AND
CAPES, JACKETS AND CHILD'S BEDROOM
SLIPPERS</small></h2>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Having</span> become well acquainted with the
stitches and patterns described in the previous
chapter, you are competent to go on
with the more intricate ones described in this chapter.</p>

<p>A pretty doll's cap is made of silk.   Without
a silk padded lining the cap will be just the thing
for the warmer months.</p>

<p><i>Doll's Cap.</i></p>

<p>Begin by winding silk around a lead pencil 12
times: make 24 s c over this.</p>

<p>2nd row&mdash;Make 2 s c in every s c on first row.</p>

<p>3rd row&mdash;S c in every s c on 2nd row.</p>

<p>Continue widening often enough to keep the work
nearly flat (to do this two s c instead of one are
worked upon the one of the preceding row). This
completes the solid work of the crown.</p>

<p>4th row&mdash;Ch 3, make 3 d c in same stitch, skip
4 d c in next st. Continue around entire crown.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span></p>

<p>5th row&mdash;Make a shell of 6 d c in centre of
each shell of 4 d c, leaving off within 7 shells of
last row.</p>

<p>6th row&mdash;Make a ch of 5 st and s c in middle
of next shell. Ch 5, s c in middle of next shell.
Continue around entire crown.</p>

<p>7th row&mdash;* 5 s c on each ch of 5 of previous
row. Turn s c for entire row around to where
the shells of 4 were left. This begins the front of
cap. Turn and repeat from * 2 more rows. Next
make a row of shells of 4 st in every 5th st.</p>

<p>8th row&mdash;Make shell of 5 d c in middle of
each shell of 4 d c. Repeat these 2 groups of 4
rows of s c and 2 rows of shells twice more.</p>

<p>9th row&mdash;A row of 5 ch in middle of each shell,
then a row of s c. Finish the cap with a row of
shells of 7 d c around the entire cap. Finish shells
with a row of picots made by a ch of 3 caught in
every st with a s c. This completes the cap.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">

<div class="caption">Fig. 242. Doll's Hug-me-tight </div>

<p><i>Doll's Hug-Me-Tight</i> (<a href="#Fig242">Figure 242</a>).</p>

<p>1 skein of Saxony white.</p>

<p>1 skein of Shetland floss, blue.</p>

<p>1&#8531; yards of narrow white ribbon.</p>

<p>Make a ch of 20 st., take up each ch with a s c.</p>

<p>Turn 19 s c in slipper stitch (slipper stitch is s c
taken up on the back thread of the row below).<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
Crochet back and forth in this manner until you
have 8 ribs or 16 rows which form the back. Then
take up 5 s c and crochet back and forth until you
have 9 ribs or 18 rows, which forms the one front.
Then count nine stitches for the neck, taking up
the remaining 5 sts for the other front and make 9
ribs or 18 rows for the other front. Finish with a
border all around of s c taking up the whole stitch,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
alternating the colours, 1 row blue and 1 white until
you have four blue and four white, finish the whole
with a blue picot.</p>

<p>Cut the ribbon into six pieces, sew one piece in
each of the outer edges to form the armhole and
front as illustrated. This jacket can be made for a
child by commencing with 45 ch, 25 ribs for back
and 25 ribs for fronts.</p>

<p><i>Jacket</i> (<a href="#Fig243">Figure 243</a>).</p>

<div class="caption">Fig. 243. Jacket in star stitch</div>
</div>

<p>Pompadour wool through which a thread of silk
runs, was used for making this pretty jacket.
Three skeins of the wool are required.</p>

<p>The body of the sacque is of star stitch (<a href="#Fig244">Figure
244</a>).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span></p>

<p>Ch 95 on which work 11 stars, widen with 2 ch.</p>

<p>For sleeve make 11 stars, and back, 25 stars.</p>

<p>One front 11 stars. For the first 4 rows of front work
11 stars, widen with 2 ch work across sleeve, widen
2, work across back, widen 1 star every other row; at
sleeve widen 2, across sleeve widen 2, then 11 stars
from the front. After the 4th row continue as
before, only widening 1 star at the four sleeve points
for 10 rows. In 15th row work 11 stars for the
sleeve, now drop out the entire sleeve, including the
widening points, work across back alone, leave out
sleeve as before then 11 stars for the second front;
work 12 rows across sacque widening under arms
as in centre back. Tie wool at point under arm and
work 13 rows around sleeve joining each row as
made. For border, work 4 rows of knot stitch.</p>

<p><i>Slippers in single crochet</i> (<a href="#Fig245">Figure 245</a>).</p>

<p>One skein of each of two contrasting colours of
Germantown wool, one pair of soles. For making
these slippers in mercerized Perle cotton, which is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
very cool for warmer
days, two balls will be
required.</p>

<p>In making slippers
it is very essential for
the work to be as tight
as possible to prevent
it from stretching.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 235px;">
<a name="Fig245"></a><img src="images/i_353.jpg" width="235" height="600" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 245. Slipper in single crochet </div>
</div>

<p>The following directions
are for slipper
size 3. Ch 11 sts.
Make 11 s c in slipper
stitch, described in
doll's hug-me-tight
(<a href="#Fig246">Figure 246</a>) widen
in the centre by making
3 s c in 1 ch.
Make two rows like
last widening in centre,
then a row
without widening.
When the work reaches
from the toe to
the hollow part of the
sole (about 12 ribs) the
front is long enough.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
(Alternate two rows one colour and two in the
other.) Turn and work 15 s c. Continue in the
slipper stitch until the work will reach around the
sole by stretching. Join the end to the front by
overcasting on the wrong side. Beginning at the
corner where the end is joined make a row of crazy
stitch around to the other side. Make 3 more
rows of crazy stitch.   Finish with a row of shells.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<a name="Fig246"></a><img src="images/i_354.jpg" width="500" height="156" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 246. Slipper stitch </div>
</div>

<p>Directions for crazy stitch&mdash;Make a ch of 4 sts;
then throw the thread once over the needle, take
up the third nearest stitch to the needle, and pull
it through the loop; throw the thread over again
and pull it through the nearest two loops on needle
and crochet the remaining two loops off in the same
manner. This completes the d c described in
<a href="#Fig229">chapter 27</a>. Make two more d c in the same loop,
skip 3 stitches, fasten with a sl st in next st 3 ch.
4 shells in next st. and continue for length desired.</p>

<p><i>Slippers in Star Stitch</i> (<a href="#Fig247">Figure 247</a>).</p>

<p>4 balls of mercerized crochet cotton.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span></p>

<p>Star stitch is made by a ch of the required length.
Insert hook in 2nd ch from it, draw wool through,
keeping both sts on hook, insert hook in 3rd ch and
draw wool through keeping this st also on the hook,
skip the next ch and take up the 4th and 5th in same
manner, making 5 sts on hook; now drop the strands
of wool from which these sts were made, and take up
wool of contrasting colour, double end into a loop
with short end about one inch in length, draw this
through all the sts on hook, being careful not to let
this short end slip through, ch 1 to hold sts in place.
Now with this new strand work a star by drawing it
through the eye of star, it being the tightest stitch
near the ch on hook keeping both sts on hook as
before.</p>

<p>Draw wool also through long st down the side of
star, then through next 2 ch which gives 5 sts on
hook, then dropping the strand from which this star
was made pick up the wool of 1st star and loop it
through these 5 sts and ch 1 to hold the star in place.
This ch should be worked tight so it will draw the
sts together and form the star, which should be
almost square. In the second row place the contrasting
colour over the star underneath, tying in
the wool, ch 3 on which take up 2 sts; this gives
you 3 sts on hook, the next 2 loops are drawn through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>
the long and short
stitches of star underneath,
taking up back
stitch of the long and
both strands of the
short or eye of star.</p>

<div class="caption">Fig. 247. A slipper in star stitch </div>
</div>

<p><i>For the slipper proper.</i></p>

<p>Ch 9, on which make
3 stars, 2 ch at end then
work 3 stars down the
other side of ch, taking
up the other thread.</p>

<p>2nd row&mdash;4 stars, 2
ch, 4 stars.</p>

<p>3d row&mdash;without
widening.</p>

<p>Widen 2 stars every
other row until you
have 10 rows 2 rows
without widening, then
widen in the next.</p>

<p>There will be 13 rows
in all, and 20 stars in
this last row, now divide
front and work
20 stars on either half<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
for the sides; fit around sole by stretching and
sew up the back on the wrong side. The wool or
thread should be broken at the end of each row.
(Crochet should not be worked backward and forward
unless directions are given to that effect.)</p>

<p>For a frill around the slippers work groups of
6 ch st two more rows of the same. I always sew
my slippers onto the soles after being finished, by
overcasting with wool of the same shade on the
right side, which saves stretching the slippers all
out of shape when turning them.</p>

<p><i>Jacket in Shell Stitch</i> (<a href="#Fig248">Figure 248</a>).</p>

<p>Material: 5 skeins of white Germantown and 1
skein of colour for edge. No. 7 bone needle.</p>

<p>Ch 127, with 3 extra sts for turning.</p>

<p>1st row&mdash;Skip 2 ch and make 4 d c in the next.
* Skip 3 ch, 1 s c in next, ch 3, 4 d c in same st with
s c and repeat from * ending with a final s c.</p>

<p>2nd row&mdash;Turn 1 s c in s c below * 2 d c in same
st, 1 s c in next s c below and repeat from * ending
with a s c in top of turning ch.</p>

<p>3rd row&mdash;Turn ch 3, 4 d c in s c below * 1 s c
in next s c, ch 3, 4 d c in same st repeat from * to
end of row.</p>

<p>Repeat 2nd and 3rd rows 9 times, then repeat
the 2nd row once more.   This gives a depth of work<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
sufficient for the back part of sleeves. At the end
of the last row fasten off.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">

<div class="caption">Fig. 248. Half of a jacket in shell stitch </div>
</div>

<p>The lower part of the back is now to be made.
Count 8 shells (sh) along from the end of the last row
and begin to crochet there, working as with 3rd row
until within 8 sh of each other end of last long row.</p>

<p>Crochet in pattern upon this row until 11 rows in
all have been worked. Upon the 12th row increase
1 sh in the 2 s c from each end by making 2 sh in
those st instead of one.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span></p>

<p>Work without increasing for 13 rows more, then
fasten off.</p>

<p>Go back to the foundation and upon the other
side of it, beginning where the first row ended, crochet
13 sh as in 1st row. This is the commencement
of the left shoulder and front.</p>

<p>Upon this row work 3 rows more in the usual way.
At the end of the last row drop the loop temporarily
from the needle, tie in an extra ball of wool at the
top of the very beginning of the last row, ch 12 and
fasten off. With this ch the extra width for the
centre of the front is secured.</p>

<p>5th row&mdash;Again take the dropped loop upon the
needle and crochet as usual making 3 sh upon the
extra ch. The row is now 16 sh wide. Work in
pattern for 17 rows more, the last row ending at the
wrist.   Fasten off.</p>

<p>On the 1st short row of lower front count 8 sh
along from end of last row, begin there, work as
usual to the other end, then crochet back and forth
until the front is as long as the back, increasing 1 sh
on the 13th row in the 2 s c from the underarm
seam. The second front is made exactly like the
first. The 3rd pattern row now is worked up the
fronts around the neck, across the lower edge of
jacket and sleeves, then finished with a scalloped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>
edge worked as follows: Make 1 s c in space
preceding st where s c was made on row below,
ch 5, 1 s c on top of 1st d c below, ch 4, 1 s c in same
space, ch 5 and repeat from beginning around all
the edges, fasten off.</p>

<p>Shape the jacket by crocheting the sleeves and
underarm seams together.</p>

<p>Crochet should be carefully washed and should
not be put in the general laundry. Make suds of
warm water and a little borax. Put the article, if of
cotton or linen thread in and let it soak for a little
while, then squeeze the water out of the article
between the hands. Rinse in several waters in this
manner always using warm water.</p>

<p>Put the piece in a white bag and hang on the line.</p>

<p>This way keeps the piece from stretching out of
shape. Keep it on the line till the article is perfectly
dry.</p>

<p>Knitted articles should also be treated in like
manner when washing for if a knitted piece was
pinned on a line to dry the article would be
stretched out of shape.</p>

<h2><a name="XXIX" id="XXIX"></a>XXIX<br /><br />
<small>IRISH CROCHET LACE</small></h2>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Irish Crochet</span> lace is one of the most durable
of laces and is suitable to be worn for all
occasions. It especially recommends itself
for pick-up or porch work. It looks well and
does not take an endless while to make, as almost
every motif is made separately thus giving a variety.
And although one may not have more than a few
minutes to devote each day to the work, it is surprising
how many articles can be completed with
little effort and little time.</p>

<p>The materials necessary are a steel crochet hook,
considerably finer than for ordinary crochet work,
as the work must be very firm, even and close.
Irish Crochet Thread, numbers 36 to 50 or D. M. C.
cotton numbers 70 to 100 inclusive and number
10 for the padding cotton will be needed. All
laces look better if pressed before making up, this
is especially true of Irish Crochet. And when slightly
soiled it can be washed in soap suds, made from any
good laundry soap; rinse thoroughly in several<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>
waters, starch slightly and iron on the wrong side
on a heavy blanket. These simple directions help
to make the lace look like new. In Irish Crochet
the motifs are made separately mostly worked over
a padding cotton.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">

<div class="caption">Fig. 249. Doily with crochet edge </div>
</div>

<p>Then these motifs are basted on a pattern of
cambric, or paper muslin which has been cut to the
desired shape. A row of chainstitching is worked
and basted to the edge of the pattern, then the filling
in background is worked, joining the different motifs
together with rows of chainstitching and picots or
any other background stitch desired.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Doily with Irish Crochet Edge</i> (<a href="#Fig249">Figure 249</a>).</p>

upon a foundation, which is the ordinary cotton
waist belting, one inch wide sold at all notion counters

<small>KNITTING, PLAIN AND PURLING, WASH RAGS, AND
FANCY STITCHES FOR SHAWLS</small></h2>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">There</span> are certain terms used in knitting
that are peculiar to the work. Until
these terms are studied and practised,
the instructions are as bad as trying to read a
foreign language that you know nothing about.</p>

<p>Knitting is usually done on two needles though
there are times when more needles are used, for
instance, in knitting stockings.</p>

<p>Thread, silk or worsted can be used for the work.
The latter is best for practising the first stitches
or pieces.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 400px;">
<a name="Fig256"></a><img src="images/i_380.jpg" width="400" height="335" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 256. Casting-on </div>
</div>

<p>The first term we learn in knitting is "to cast
on stitches" (<a href="#Fig256">Figure 256</a>). Select a pair of medium-sized
wooden needles. Your worsted should be
wound into a ball. "Casting on" is the foundation
for the work. Take a knitting needle in each hand
between the thumb and first finger. Make a loop
of the worsted over the left-hand needle near the
end. Put your right-hand needle through this loop<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span>
under the left needle. Holding the needles in this
position, throw the worsted around the point of the
right-hand needle
and draw the right-hand
needle through
the first loop. There
is now a loop on each
needle. Slip the last
loop made over the
left needle. * Both
needles are in the one
loop, the left on top
of the right. Again throw the worsted over the
point of the right-hand needle and draw the
needle through with the loop on it. Slip this loop
over the left-hand needle and repeat from *, till the
number of stitches desired are cast on.</p>

<p>The * indicates from which point the directions
are to be repeated.</p>

<p>The German method of knitting is to hold the
work in the left hand and the worsted over the
first finger, under the second and third and then
over the little finger.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 500px;">
<a name="Fig257"></a><img src="images/i_381.jpg" width="500" height="452" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 257. Knitting (K) </div>
</div>

<p>To knit, the right-hand needle is in the first loop
from the point of the other needle. * Throw the
worsted over point of the right-hand needle and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span>
draw it through the loop. Slip the first stitch off the
left needle and insert the right needle into the next
stitch and repeat
from *, till all the
stitches have been
transferred to the
right-hand needle
(<a href="#Fig257">Figure 257</a>).</p>

<p>Remember to
hold the work in
the left hand when
starting to knit
each needle or row.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 500px;">
<a name="Fig258"></a><img src="images/i_381a.jpg" width="500" height="456" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 258. Purling (P) </div>
</div>

<p>To purl (<a href="#Fig258">Figure 258</a>). The work is held in the
left hand. The
worsted is brought
in front of the
work. The right-hand
needle is inserted
through the
stitch from right
to left in front of
the left needle.
Pass the point of
the right needle
over the worsted and draw the loop through. Slip<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span>
off the stitch on the left needle as in knitting. Repeat
in this manner until all the stitches are transferred.</p>

<p>Sometimes it is necessary to get rid of some of
the stitches. In that case the needle is slipped
through two stitches instead of one and the new
stitch formed in the usual way. There are two
abbreviations for purling two together. They are
p. 2 tog. or p-n.   The latter means purl narrow.</p>

<p>When knitting, two stitches can also be taken
together. The abbreviation for this is n. K. 3 tog.
means knit three stitches (sts) together as one stitch.</p>

<p>To slip-stitch means to take a stitch from the
left-hand to the right-hand needle without knitting
it, and its abbreviation is sl.</p>

<p>To bind or cast off means to slip the stitches from
the needle so that you have a chain edge. Slip
the first stitch and knit the second. You now have
two loops on the right-hand needle. * Put the point
of the left needle (from left to right) through the
first stitch on the other needle. Hold the worsted
tight. Slip the right-hand needle through the loop
formed as described above and then slip the loop
from the left needle. There is only one loop on
the right-hand needle. Knit the next stitch and
repeat from *.
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span></p>

<p>Casting off must be done loosely or the work
will have a puckered appearance.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<a name="Fig259"></a><img src="images/i_383.jpg" width="600" height="548" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 259. A little girl's first piece of knitting</div>
</div>

<p>It may be that you desire to widen the row of
stitches. Both widening and decreasing is done at
the end of needle or row. Knit as usual till there
remains but one loop on the left-hand needle. Insert
the left-hand needle through the loop at the base
of the last stitch.   Bring worsted around the point<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span>
and make a stitch as usual. The last stitch is
knitted in the usual way.</p>

<p>After you have practised the stitches with wool,
it is well to buy a ball of coarse knitting cotton and
a pair of steel needles. The cotton makes excellent
wash cloths. Cast on 50 stitches then knit
or purl the same amount of rows as stitches. To
make a fancy cloth knit three rows then purl three
rows until you have the fifty rows.</p>

<p>The long straight shawls are the most popular
at present.</p>

<p>A little one for yourself that would be quite
pretty is made in pop corn stitch (<a href="#Fig260">Figure 260</a>).
It requires five skeins of worsted and a pair of wooden
needles.</p>

<div class="caption">Her First Knitted Shawl</div>
</div>

<p>
Cast on 59 stitches on your needle.</p>

<p>1st row&mdash;K 1st, then knit two stitches together
(2 K tog) the rest of the way. You now have 30
stitches on your needle (<a href="#Fig260">Figure 260</a>).</p>

<p>2nd row&mdash;K first stitch, then knit the loop
which is formed between the double stitches of
the first row. Continue in this manner till you
have again on the needle the same number you cast
on&mdash;59.</p>

<p>3rd row&mdash;K plain all the way across.</p>

<p>4th row&mdash;P plain all the way across.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span></p>
<p>5th row&mdash;K 2 together all the way across to the
last stitch, then k that by itself.</p>

<p>6th row&mdash;Same as second row.</p>

<p>7th row&mdash;K plain.</p>

<p>8th row&mdash;P plain.</p>

<p>Continue in this manner till you make a scarf
about one yard long.</p>

<div class="caption">Fig. 260. The popcorn stitch </div>
</div>

<p>The popcorn pattern affords good practice for
the different stitches explained before.</p>

<p>If a longer shawl is desired continue in the same
manner. To make it broader it will be necessary
to cast on more stitches at the beginning.</p>

<p>A shawl may be finished in many ways. Sometimes
a little crochet edge is worked around it, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span>
a chain stitch fringe can be made. The plain fringe
is the one most used however. This is made by
cutting the wool about ten inches long. Take four
lengths and slip them through and knot them into
the border edge at each end of the shawl. This

<h2><a name="XXXII" id="XXXII"></a>XXXII<br /><br />
<small>EMBROIDERY SUGGESTIONS FOR BOARDING
SCHOOL GIRL</small></h2>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">A girl</span> who has to make a home of her
boarding school should try and make her
room and little personal articles as attractive
as possible. Her room is her citadel where
only her bosom friends and cronies meet. One
likes to feel when they enter their room that it is
a place where everything is hers and every object
in sight means something to her.</p>

<p>A girl might not like to embroider, yet there are
hundreds of things that can be done without any
needlework decoration, such as stencilling, cut
leather or simple appliqu&eacute;. It always amused me
to hear a girl say, "I don't like to embroider."
I always feel like asking her, if we are acquainted,
if she knows how to embroider. You will find that
in nine cases out of ten she does not. Embroidery
is like anything else, you have got to know
it to like it. It may be you prefer one branch to
others. Some branches of this work may be tedious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[373]</a></span>
to you but when you stop and think what simple
things are classed under embroidery you will find
that you have a wide field from which to select.</p>

<p>It is not my object to go into details in regard
to stitchery in this chapter but rather to give you
some helpful suggestions in regard to knowing what
to make and what colours to use. The stitches
to be used are fully described in the previous
chapters.</p>

<p>The first thing to consider is, are you going to have
a bedstead or a couch in your room? Make it the
latter unless you have a broad window seat that you
can heap up with pillows. No room at a boarding
school or college is complete without a half a dozen
pretty pillows. When the chairs give out you can
use the cushions, Japanese fashion, on the floor.
Some girls like to carry their whole room out in
cretonne, which is very pretty and dainty if you can
afford it. Cretonne covers last about a year and
then they get faded and dusty, while a linen background
embroidered will last for many years. It may
need laundering but it will stand any amount of that.
If the embroidery fades a little that also is no drawback
as it takes the effect of newness from the room.
A room ought to look as if people lived in it and
enjoyed it and not as if it were an exhibition room<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[374]</a></span>
in some department store. Don't think I am trying
to encourage untidiness but let the things be used
and enjoyed.</p>

<p>When I was about your age for several weeks
I spent my spare time embroidering a centre piece
for my auntie's dining room table taking care to
get just the right colours that would look well with
her every day china. It nearly broke my heart
when it was finished to have her use it only for state
occasions. If my cousins do not use it any more
than auntie did it will last for hundreds of years,
or be thrown into the rag bag by the next generations
if they don't like it. Enjoy all the pretty
things that you possess if they are appropriate for
the use you intend them for.</p>

<p>Have you ever heard the story of the little dirty
boy of the slums who was given a new white tie
by his teacher? He had first to wash his hands before
he touched it and then he washed himself to wear it
and asked his mother for a clean shirt so that everything
would go with the tie? Do you know that if
you have one beautiful thing in your room of
which you are very proud you too will see that all
the things around it set off its beauty?</p>

<p>For the girl who has a window seat in a room and
wants to keep her room dainty and bright there is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[375]</a></span>
nothing as pretty as the lingerie pillow. It may be
made of heavy white linen or lawn as you desire
and can be oblong, round or square. The cushion is
covered in any colour that you prefer and the white
top embroidered with large eyelets, Roman cut
work, Hardanger or drawn work so that the colour
will appear through the openings. Some of the
handsomest imported pillows have motifs of real
Filet, Irish Crochet or Cluny lace. These motifs
are very expensive and not really necessary. The
back and front of the linen cover are scalloped on
the edges and half an inch above this scalloping a
row of large eyelets is worked at intervals. The
back and front are laced together with ribbons the
same shade as the coloured covering. For a pink
and blue room the cushion can be covered with
pink and the lingerie slip laced with blue. For a
square pillow plan the design on a square and arrange
one in each corner and one in the direct centre.</p>

<p>These slips will require frequent laundering.</p>

<p>The lithographed pillow is a thing to be avoided
by a girl of refined taste. You would not hang
lithograph posters in your bedroom so why feel that
it is all right to buy a lithograph pillow?</p>

<p>The chief point to remember in getting little
accessories for your room is to keep the colouring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[376]</a></span>
as harmonious as possible. Avoid getting the
popular things of to-day which are apt to be an
eyesore to you to-morrow.</p>

<p>Do not decide quickly to carry out your room in
school colours, there will probably be a dozen of the
girls who will do this very thing and you will be
tired of it before your course is through. A fraternity
pillow is to be expected as there are dozens of
ways that it may be treated and look quite different
from the other girls' pillows.</p>

<p>The general way in which a school or fraternity
pillow is made is to cut out of felt the letters, figures
and any design that is to be placed on it. The
background may be broadcloth, ladies' cloth or
felt. Use one of the school or fraternity colours
for the appliqu&eacute; and the other for the background.</p>

<p>One of the handsomest fraternity pillows I ever
saw, was one belonging to a Hamilton College
man. Hamilton's colours are buff and bright deep
blue. The fraternity's colours were black and
gold. A handsome piece of Hamilton blue broadcloth
was selected for the background. The fraternity
pin was reproduced in colour in fine filo silk.
The gold silk was a perfect match to the gold in the
pin. Even the background of the pin, which was
black enamel, was represented by very fine Kensington<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[377]</a></span>
stitches. The rope-like edge of the pin was
reproduced on the pillow by little rope-like sections
heavily padded and worked in gold silk. On the
back of the pillow were his initial and his class year
below. No beruffled ribbons or gaudy cord detracted
from its richness. It was a square cushion
and its only finish was a large button in each corner
where the end was gathered and tucked in to give
a round effect.</p>

<p>The school girl of to-day is learning to eliminate
the unnecessary trumpery things that cheapen the
room and serve as dust gatherers. Outside of
the pillow, bed or table covers and an occasional
bag for fancy work, laundry or gloves there is no
ornate display of handwork. Even the walls are
left bare with the exception of a framed print or a
few family photographs.</p>

<p>Try if possible and see if you can get a plain paper
for your wall. More than one really charming room
is spoiled by having an atrocious paper on it. It
is really impossible to try to be artistic with an
ugly wall paper.</p>

<p>Since stencilling has become so popular, it is not
an uncommon thing to have the entire room stencilled.</p>

<p>Suppose you had planned to have your room in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[378]</a></span>
lilac, green and light gray. White can be substituted
for the gray but it soils more readily than the
latter. The floor should be polished and a couple
of small rugs or one larger one be used on the floor.
The lilac shade should predominate in the rug.
The covers should be of the gray or white with a
stencilled design in green and lilac. A pretty way
to treat the pillow is to get inexpensive lilac material
of a coarse texture. Cut a square about fourteen
or fifteen inches. Cut four strips of white or gray
five inches wide by twenty-five inches long. These
strips should be finer than the lilac or of a different
weave. Baste one strip on each side of the lilac
square. Mitre the strips at the corners. A design
is then stencilled on the four strips in lilac and
green. The backing of the pillow should be in
plain lilac.</p>

<p>If preferred a striped lilac and white piece of
material can be used for the centre and back.</p>

<p>For the girl who is fond of initials or monograms
I would suggest that the cover be hemstitched and
a wreath selected in different sizes appropriate to
the article on which it is to be used. These wreaths
can be carried out in colour or the background may
be coloured and the wreaths white. Inside of the
wreath work your monogram or initial. If you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[379]</a></span>
desire a Dutch room, carry out this scheme in Delft
blue material and have a dark set of Mission
furniture.</p>

<p>Nile green linen with wreaths of conventionalized
rosebuds or daisies, worked in shades of pink, or
white and yellow, suggests a French room, with a
brass bedstead. As I have stated in the chapter
on initials, the stem stitch is pretty for working
single lines of a design that is carried out in satin-stitch.</p>

<p>Stem stitch is too slow a method however to embroider
school linens, and I would suggest using a
substitute that has the effect and yet does not
require the time. A row of outlining is made, and
then turn the work back in the same manner, this
time instead of working through the material, catch
the places where the two successive stitches of the
first row overlap (<a href="#Fig269">Figure 269</a>.)</p>

<p>Another wrinkle you might be glad to hear of
and possibly want to put in practice is how to clean
a daintily embroidered piece without washing it,
such as a pincushion or pillow top. School is not
like home where you can be sure a piece sent to
the laundry will have proper attention. Another
drawback is that all extras have to be well paid
for. If the piece is thickly covered with white<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[380]</a></span>
talcum powder and allowed to stand without disturbing
it for forty-eight hours, the embroidery
will emerge almost as clean as if it had been
laundered.</p>

<p>Now then there are the curtains for your room.
You may be fortunate enough to have a room with
dainty dotted swiss or dimity curtains that will
go very nicely with the things you are planning and
then again you may be inflicted with a pair of cheap
imitation lace curtains. If you can possibly afford
it change them as soon as possible. Personally I
would rather have no curtains than the wrong ones.
Dimity, dotted swiss, scrim, plain net or grass
linen are materials that are inexpensive as well as
artistic. Of course you can make them as fancy as
you wish. Any of the above mentioned materials
can be stencilled. Rick-rack braid, which is a wavy
braid, can be used to edge the net curtains or a
Connemara lace design is also appropriate.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[381]</a></span></p>

<p>A narrow crochet edge can be used on the edge
of the scrim curtains or a narrow border of drawn
work can be used.</p>

<p>Shadow work is effective on dimity or dotted
swiss curtains. Another pretty stitch very similar
to the shadow stitch is the skeleton stitch. Instead
of the work being on the wrong side it all
appears on the right. Work a row of very fine
running stitches on the right side. Fagot stitch
from side to side catching the thread into the running
stitches. The work is done from the centre
of the flower to the tip of the petal. Do not end
your thread but weave over and under the fagotting
stitch to the end of the petal, leaf or space on which
you are working.</p>

<p>The curtains may be sash lengths or may be the
full length of the window but do not make them
longer than to reach the sill.</p>
